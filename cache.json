JavaScript drives everything from small widgets and form validation to full-fledged all-in JS sites.\nKeep in mind that disabled JavaScript is not the primary reason why applications break.

It uses less memory than Go’s built-in map and is well-suited for performance-sensitive contexts where memory use for large hash tables is a concern – though, as always, there are tradeoffs to consider.

Maybe — betteralign is a tool to detect structs that would use less memory if their fields were sorted and to then, optionally, sort such fields. It’s a fork of Go’s own fieldalignment tool that skips generated or test files, skips specially marked structs, doesn’t drop comments, and similar DX enhancements.\nDinko Korunic \n\n\n  \n  \nImplementing a Generic Set Type — To celebrate the first anniversary of generics in Go (Go 1.18 was released in March 2022), John decided to build something useful with them: a generic Set type, complete with useful methods.\nJohn Arundel \n\n\n  \n  \nGo!
