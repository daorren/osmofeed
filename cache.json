          "description": "I like geeking out on my local shell setup, and my dotfiles hold a few aliases I can't live without ‚Äì ll, ni, nr and all these other two-character commands are deeply engrained in my muscle memory.\nTo define an alias, you set a new command name and map it to another command.\nalias ll='exa -la --git --icons'\n\nToday I learned that the alias command in Zsh also supports a -s flag which enables suffix aliases. As a result, this is a valid alias in Zsh:\n# \"Run\" the file to look at its content\n# $ index.html\n# -> cat index.html\nalias -s html=cat\n\nYou can \"just run files\" with a suffix alias without defining a command or making it an executable. After defining the alias above, executing index.html on your terminal will be expanded and shuffled to cat index.html. üò≤\nIf you want to learn more about suffix aliases, access its manual via man zshbuiltins on the command line.\nBut there's more! You can define a suffix alias for multiple file types, too. I added cat (aliased to bat on my machine) as the standard handling of the following file formats.\n# \"Run\" the file to look at its content\n# $ ./readme.md\n# -> cat ./readme.md\nalias -s {js,json,env,md,html,css,toml}=cat\n\nI'm super into this shorter way of looking into text files quickly.\nThis functionality is pretty neat already, but there's more (even though it might be a bit of a hack). @_smhmd pointed out that they use suffix aliases to save typing git clone when cloning a git repository. They paste the repo SSH link into the terminal, and it's expanded to a proper clone command. Smart! üò≤\n# \"Run\" ssh links to clone repos\n# $ git@github.com:stefanjudis/dotfiles.git\n# -> git clone git@github.com:stefanjudis/dotfiles.git\nalias -s git=\"git clone\"\n\nDo you know of more suffix alias use cases?
