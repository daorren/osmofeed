          "description": "Suppose you're using a password manager (if you don't, go and install one now — the internet is a scary place, and breaches happen all the time); you might have run into situations when your password manager comes up with a nicely cryptic and unique password that'll be rejected by a website because it's too long, uses not allowed characters or other nonsense.\nIf that happens, you should evaluate if you really want to subscribe somewhere, but it's also poor UX. Wouldn't it be great if there was a declarative way to inform password managers about supported password combinations?\nIt turns out there is — sort of. If you're in the Apple ecosystem and use the native password management tools, Safari supports a passwordrules HTML attribute to control its password autofill feature. 1Password also seems to pick up the attribute.\n<input type=\"password\" \n  passwordrules=\"minlength: 8; required: lower; required: upper; required: digit; required: [_];\">\n\nIf you want to play around with passwordrules, Apple provides a tool to generate rules and you can test it out in Safari. The feature worked for simple configurations but enforcing Unicode characters such as ⭐ didn't work for me. 😅\nAs far as I can tell, there's no proper spec about the HTML attribute yet, but it's up for discussion since 2018 (thanks Dennis Schubert). And while digging deeper (thanks Thomas Broyer), I discovered that passwordrules probably won't go anywhere soon because Mozilla doesn't think it's a good idea.\nLet's see how this turns out!\nMultiple folks pointed out that passwort restrictions are useless because the only thing protecting against a brutforce attack is password length. I'm no security expert and might do some reading to update the post later.\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",

          "description": "Guten Tag! 👋\n\nDo you want to catch up with all the new CSS features? And then want to establish a strategy to use them in production? Or make a great impression when you onboard a new job?\nAll the answers and much more are included in this week's Web Weekly!\nOur friends at Google released a new WebDev term at Google.io — \"the baseline\". Usually, I'm no fan of new tech lingo (MPA anyone? 😅), but I can get behind this one.\nThe baseline describes features supported in the current and previous versions of all major browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and  Safari). So that it replaces the mouthful \"feature ABC is cross-browser supported\".\nAnd the term isn't only a Google effort but a collaboration of Apple, Microsoft, and Mozilla. Get ready because we can expect many new baseline widgets like th…",

It’s been around a few years, but has just added Vue 3.3 support and a Vite-based Vue template.\nSasha Shpota \n\n\n  \n  \nA Quick Crash Course on Go Generics — The generics fever around v1.18's release has quietened down a lot, and they're now a fundamental part of Go.

This is something you can comfortably ignore in 2023.” Quite!\nBen E. C.
