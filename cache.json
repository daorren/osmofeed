Prettier for the win!\nBut I've always been in \"the space camp\" for my projects. It's my code, and I make the rules, right?\nThis week I took a big step, moved camps and changed my first repo to be tabs-first!\nSo, what changed my opinion?\nThe Prettier maintainers consider moving to tabs with their next major release because it saves bytes and is more flexible. Let's dive into these points.\nI converted all JS files (including all node_modules) of my blog's code base to tabs and saved a whooping 11MB on my hard drive.

Thousands of lines will be marked with an unimportant formatting change.\nI started googling around to find out how to ignore commits in Git and VS code...\nIgnore commits via --ignore-rev\n\nIf you use git blame on the command line, the --ignore-rev option lets you blame a file without considering this nasty formatting commit.\ngit blame --ignore-rev a926bba49c index.js\n\nThis is great but didn't help me because I rarely use git blame on the command line, and even if I would, I wouldn't want to always think …",

It's hands-down the :has() pseudo-class for me, because :has() flips CSS around, and content will finally be able to influence styling!\nDave Rupert published a post including this :has() selector to style the first element but only if it's included in an odd-numbered list.\nBut there's a surprise: you don't even need :has() for this. Temani Afif shared that you can do it with nth-last-of-type, too.\nAnd while we're at it, do you remember this snippet? It's a CSS quantity query to select li elements, but only if there are three or more list elements. 🤯\nI'm blown away by all this CSS magic, but I wonder how wild and complicated future CSS will become.
