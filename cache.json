A quick-to-add JS snippet enabled site owners to implement Facebook functionality, and the social media giant started tracking people across the web.\nIt's been wild times, and luckily, things are different today. People are more privacy aware, (some) browsers started blocking all these trackers, and I stopped using Facebook years ago.\nBut I do watch many YouTube videos. And this made me think: how does YouTube treat privacy when you embed a video?\nI was delighted to learn about YouTube's privacy-enhanced embed mode!\nIf you turn it on, the iframe source changes from youtube.com/embed/[ID] to youtube-nocookie.com/embed/[ID]. That's pretty cool!\nBut unfortunately, I just stumbled upon Jason Grigsby's disappointment about the feature.\nSo what's up?\nFirst, the domain youtube-nocookie.com seemed to have been a cute developer idea until the business decided that dropping all cookies isn't great for the ad monetization model. youtube-nocookie.com does not mean no cookies.\n\"We won't store user info unless you interact with the embed\".\nOuch... but fair; YouTube doesn't hide what they're doing here. youtube-nocookie.com isn't more than an unfortunate domain choice, but hey, we've all bought silly domains at some point, right?\nBut it's not okay that the explainer claims that the embed only starts storing user info after an interaction.\nI just tried it out, and look what I've found in my localstorage. 🤦‍♂️\nSo much about, \"we won't store user info unless you play the video\".

          "description": "On my font optimization journey, I've learned that subsetting is an invaluable approach to reducing font file sizes. I've been able to cut down Roboto's size from 785kB to 200kB by subsetting it to ASCII characters. And when going the extreme way, I could even bring it down to 58kB by aggressively limiting the included characters.\nBut could one squeeze out even more bytes of the Roboto font?\nWhen you inspect Roboto with Wakamai Fondue, you'll discover that it ships 13(!) variable font axes.\nThat's great, but I wonder if you need all these variable configuration parameters in production and argue that a good design defines only a few font variations. 13 configurable axes shouldn't be needed at all times.\nThanks to Tobias Kunish, I learned you can also remove axes with some tooling! Does the removal of font axes affect the font size? Let's find out!\nSlice is an open-source application to create custom font design spaces from variable fonts. Unfortunately, I'm not enough font nerd to understand all of Slice's functionality, but what I get is that you can inspect a font's axes and limit their ranges or define a static value for each.\nFor example, if you're not interested in including all the variations of the parametric figure height (YTFI), set a value and drop the axis from the font entirely.\nTo test things out, I kept the opsz, wght, GRAD, wdth and slnt axis untouched and set a fixed value for the eight other axes to remove them from my local Roboto font.\nFont\nSize with 13 axes\nSize with 5 axes\n\n\n\n\nRoboto (all characters & glyphs)\n784kB\n710kB\n\n\nRoboto (Latin)\n322kB\n292kB\n\n\nRoboto (ASCII)\n202kB\n182kB\n\n\nRoboto (only a few characters)\n58kB\n52kB\n\n\n\nAnd indeed, removing font axes resulted in more saved bytes!\nSo, if you're on the journey of optimizing your fonts, subsetting will give you massive results, but if you want to go the extra mile, you can also shave off some more bytes by limiting font axis range values or removing axes entirely. Happy optimizing!\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",
