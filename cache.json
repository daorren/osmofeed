          "description": "This site uses Umami as a self-hosted and privacy-first analytics tool. An item in Umami's changelog caught my eye – \"Update tracker/index.js: SendBeacon() to Fetch API\".\nsendBeacon is a JavaScript method to send requests to an analytics server. These requests are supposed to be async, not be canceled and outlive the current navigation. But apparently, sendBeacon is sometimes blocked by ad blockers.\nThat's not a big deal, though, because today I learned I can drop sendBeacon from my memory entirely and use the fetch method with a keepalive option. 👇\nfetch(`${root}/api/collect`, {\n  method: 'POST',\n  body: data,\n  // note the `keepalive` option\n  keepalive: true,\n});\n\nfetch with a keepalive option has the same characteristics as sendBeacon and acts as its replacement. This is good to know!\nDon't confuse the keepalive fetch attribute with the Keep-Alive HTTP header.\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",

          "description": "I'm a big fan of prototyping in the JavaScript console and find myself opening the developer tools just for this purpose.\nUnfortunately, console prototyping can sometimes be a little cumbersome for extensive snippets because the console isn't built for writing extended snippets spanning multiple lines. You can work around this by pressing Shift + Enter, but still, it's not great.\nToday, I was thrilled to learn that the Firefox developer tools provide a somewhat hidden multi-line console editor to write extended snippets more easily!\nThis feature is top DX in action! 💯 Thanks Firefox.\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",
