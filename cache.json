If there are components that are included and reinvented in every design system out there, shouldn't these components become HTML elements? Big yes from my side!\nAnd there are good things in the making:\nselectmenu will enable us to build styleable select controls finally.\npopup will help to show and hide elements on click or keyboard navigation.\nfocusgroup will make custom controls more accessible.\nI can't wait until I can build accessible components like the one below without JavaScript.\nThe project's still in the early stages, but I'm 100% convinced we need more high-level HTML components.

          "description": "This site uses Umami as a self-hosted and privacy-first analytics tool. An item in Umami's changelog caught my eye ‚Äì \"Update tracker/index.js: SendBeacon() to Fetch API\".\nsendBeacon is a JavaScript method to send requests to an analytics server. These requests are supposed to be async, not be canceled and outlive the current navigation. But apparently, sendBeacon is sometimes blocked by ad blockers.\nThat's not a big deal, though, because today I learned I can drop sendBeacon from my memory entirely and use the fetch method with a keepalive option. üëá\nfetch(`${root}/api/collect`, {\n  method: 'POST',\n  body: data,\n  // note the `keepalive` option\n  keepalive: true,\n});\n\nfetch with a keepalive option has the same characteristics as sendBeacon and acts as its replacement. This is good to know!\nDon't confuse the keepalive fetch attribute with the Keep-Alive HTTP header.\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",
