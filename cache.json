The content should be 65 characters wide at max. But (!) I wanted to be able to break free, and some components should go full-width by setting a class. And it should all work with CSS grid.\nAfter fiddling with it for a while, I didn't reach a satisfying result and decided to do it another day. In the meantime, Ryan Mulligan's post \"Layout Breakouts with CSS Grid\" provided the CSS solution I was looking for (see it in action on CodePen).\nThe solution: named grid-template-columns and some math\n\nPut all your content in a content wrapper element that defines named grid areas:\n.content {\n  --gap: clamp(1rem, 6vw, 3rem);\n  --full: minmax(var(--gap), 1fr);\n  --content: min(50ch, 100% - var(--gap) * 2);\n  --popout: minmax(0, 2rem);\n  --feature: minmax(0, 5rem);\n\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns:\n    [full-start] var(--full)\n    [feature-start] var(--feature)\n    [popout-start] var(--popout)\n    [content-start] var(--content) [content-end]\n    var(--popout) [popout-end]\n    var(--feature) [feature-end]\n    var(--full) [full-end];\n}\n\nAnd then control all the component widths using grid template areas. 💯\n.content > * {\n  grid-column: content;\n}\n.popout {\n  grid-column: popout;\n}\n.feature {\n  grid-column: feature;\n}\n.full {\n  grid-column: full;\n}\n\nThe post even includes a beautiful visualization that explains what's going on. 👏\nI love it. 💙 Thank you, Ryan!\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",

Some highlights from the past few years:\n\n\nBig efficiency gains on multicore systems.\nGo's scheduler spends up to 30% less CPU time spinning.\nGo's GC limits its CPU use when the app is idle, reducing CPU spikes.\ndefer-red function calls now cost as little as regular function calls (mostly).\nMore efficient timer management.\nMichael Knyszek \n\n\n  \n  \nAutomatically Detect and Trac…",
