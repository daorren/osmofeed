          "description": "Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is \"experimental\" due to these caveats:\n\nThis feature is currently only available through custom template.\niTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be \"hh:mm:ss\" or \"mm:ss\" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.\nNo image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.\nYou can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.\nFixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.\nThank you @Zenigata",

          "description": "This post is a quick reference for my future self. I implemented the eleventy cache assets plugin to speed up my local development last weekend. This site is based on API data from several sources, and unfortunately, local development became terribly slow. It was time for some optimization. The problem was that the local build process fetched all the API data on every file change and local rebuild.\nThe eleventy cache plugin helps here. It caches data across builds and writes the API data into files in a .cache directory. When the site rebuilds, the cached data is reused, and no APIs will be called during the build process.\nTo make the plugin work in a remote environment such as Netlify, it needs the .cache directory to be available. This behavior led to the problem that I had to check in the .cache directory but needed to ignore all the included files.\nI ran into this exact problem many times, and it always takes me several attempts to get it right. Here's the solution that worked for me.\nFirst, add the directory to your local project and place a .gitignore file in it.\n.cache\n  |_ .gitignore\n\nThen, paste the following configuration into the .gitignore file in the directory you want to check in.\n# File: .cache/.gitignore\n# Ignore everything in this directory\n*\n# Except for this file\n!.gitignore\n\nAnd voilà! Commit the .gitignore file at folder-you-want-to-check-in/.gitignore, and that's it! The directory is now available in git and files in this directory will be ignored.\nIt's to point out that .gitignore files work in sub-directories and allow you to configure git on a sub-directory level. And that's pretty handy!\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",

          "description": "ES modules are still reasonably new in Node.js land (they're stable since Node 14). Modules come with a built-in module system and features such as top-level await.\nI just read an informative post on ES modules by Pawel Grzybek and learned that you can't import JSON files in ES modules today. That's a real bummer because I'm pretty used to doing const data = require('./some-file.json') in Node.js.\nWhile it will be possible to import JSON from within modules eventually, the implementation is still behind a flag (--experimental-json-modules).\nThis post includes ways to deal with JSON in ES modules today.\nOption 1: Read and parse JSON files yourself\n\nThe Node.js documentation advises to use the fs module and do the work of reading the files and parsing it yourself.\nimport { readFile } from 'fs/promises';\nconst json = JSON.parse(\n  await readFile(\n    new URL('./some-file.json', import.meta.url)\n  )\n);\n\nOption 2: Leverage the CommonJS require function to load JSON files\n\nThe documentation also states that you can use createRequire to load JSON files. This is the way Pawel advises in his blog post.\ncreateRequire allows you to construct a CommonJS require function so that you can use typical CommonJS features in Node.js EcmaScript modules.\nimport { createRequire } from \"module\";\nconst require = createRequire(import.meta.url);\nconst data = require(\"./data.json\");\n\nHow should you load JSON files?\n\nI don't know. 🤷‍♂️ Neither option feels good, and I'll probably stick to the first option because it's more understandable.\nLet's see when stable JSON modules land in Node.js!\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",
