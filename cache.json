It's a good hack, but it is also unreadable. Even if you understand this border-radius declaration today, you have to write a lengthy comment so that your future self won't travel back in time to have a word with you.\nIf you describe the CSS' functionality in JavaScript, that's how it would look like.\nif (cardWidth >= viewportWidth) {\n  radius = 0;\n} else {\n  radius = 8px;\n}\n\nThat's reasonable logic!

As a heavy keyboard user, I preview the shortcut way: open the command palette with CMD + Shift + p and go directly to the experiments menu.\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n            \nLook at all these possibly upcoming Chromium DevTools features and play around with them. That's why they're there!\nCSS Overview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n            \nThere are many CSS analysis tools out there, but having them right in your developer tools is super handy. The CSS overview lists defined colors and media queries, used fonts and useless CSS declarations. It's time to clean up your CSS!\nWarnings about low contrast text\n\n\n\n\n          \n            \nLow contrast text is one of the most common accessibility issues. Tools like Lighthouse check for these when you scan your site, but wouldn't it be great if the DevTools would tell you about issues right away? I (and the Chromium DevTools folks) think so, too, and that's why you can enable \"Contrast issue reporting\" to see warnings in your console. 💯\nA new font editor tool\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n            \nI always found it hard to define and style custom fonts. The new font editor helps with that and allows to change font settings with a visual UI!\nI love all this new DevTools functionality and can't wait to see what's next!\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",

          "description": "I just had a look at the current Chrome DevTools experiments and enabled three handy new features. Let's have a look!\nHow to enable Chrome experiments\n\nFirst, how do you enable Chrome experiments?\nYou can either hit the little gear icons in the top-right corner and navigate to \"Experiments\". As a heavy keyboard user, I preview the shortcut way: open the command palette with CMD + Shift + p and go directly to the experiments menu.\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n            \nLook at all these possibly upcoming Chrome DevTools features and play around with them. That's why they're there!\nCSS Overview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n            \nThere are many CSS analysis tools out there, but having them right in your developer tools is super handy. The CSS overview lists defined colors and media queries, used fonts and useless CSS declarations. It's time to clean up your CSS!\nWarnings about low contrast text\n\n\n\n\n          \n            \nLow contrast text is one of the most common accessibility issues. Tools like Lighthouse check for these when you scan your site, but wouldn't it be great if the DevTools would tell you about issues right away? I (and the Chrome DevTools folks) think so, too, and that's why you can enable \"Contrast issue reporting\" to see warnings in your console. 💯\nA new font editor tool\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n            \nI always found it hard to define and style custom fonts. The new font editor helps with that and allows to change font settings with a visual UI!\nI love all this new DevTools functionality and can't wait to see what's next!\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",

I'm so used to my VS Code setup that I don't want to miss it.\nTo not fill my computer with random \"throw away files\", I usually create projects in the /tmp directory, test something out and forget about the files because they'll be deleted automatically.\nI rarely need to clean up my computer; if you want to learn how to avoid an overflowing Downloads directory or a desktop full of screenshots on macOS, check this blog post.\nToday I discovered the CodeSwing VS Code extension. It's like a local CodePen and precisely what I needed. It quickly spins up a demo environment, includes a snappy browser preview and automatically cleans up the files. It's beautiful!\n\n\n\n\n          \n            \nFind CodeSwing on the VS Code marketplace or, if you want to learn more, read Bramus' blog post about it.\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",

          "description": "I still define my CSS colors in hex values. 💪 rgb(), rgba(), hsl() and hsla() are valuable CSS functions, but it's so cumbersome to convert hex values (#34aa44) to numbers or percentages. That's why I never adopted the color functions.\nThe spec even includes a section explaining how to convert RGB to HSL and vice versa.\nMy rare usage is why I missed that the CSS Color Module Level 4 spec made rgba() and hsla() redundant.\nThe specification introduced two changes:\nrgb()/hsl() accept alpha values.\nColor functions accept space-separared values.\nWith rgb()/hsl() accepting transparency values, hsla() and rgba() became legacy functions and are now aliases for rgb()/hsl().\nIf you worry about browser support, check MDN. rgb()/hsl() transparency values are well supported!\nThe second edition is a new space-separated syntax, that improves readability:\n/* evolution of the rgb function with transparency */\nrgba(255, 255, 255, 50%)\nrgba(255 255 255 / 50%)\nrgb(255 255 255 / 50%)\n\n/* evolution of the hsl function with transparency */\nhsla(235, 100%, 50%, 50%) \nhsla(235 100% 50% / 100%)\nhsl(235 100% 50% / 100%)\n\nThese two new features made color handling easier! You don't have to worry about color functions that do or don't support transparency, and the space/slash syntax highlights seperates values and makes it easier to read.
