          "description": "Today I discovered an exciting section in the CSS media queries Level 5 spec. The custom media queries section explains how to define and reuse aliases for media queries. Why would you need that?\nWell... if you're using CSS custom properties and wanted to use them in a media query, you probably discovered that you can't use custom properties in this context. CSS custom properties weren't designed for that use case. Bummer!\n:root {\n  --width: 20em;\n}\n\n/* that doesn't work :/ */\n@media (min-width: var(--width)) {\n}\n\n\nYou could now rely on tools such as Sass and introduce another non-native variable system to clean up your media queries, but yeah... this approach is not great!\nBut here's the solution – say hello to custom media queries!\n@custom-media --narrow-window (max-width: 30em);\n\n@media (--narrow-window) {\n  /* narrow window styles */\n}\n\nIsn't this beautiful? I think many web developers are waiting for that for quite some time. But here's the sad news: you can't use custom media queries today because it's only future music.\nI googled around for a few minutes, and apparently, custom media queries are in the spec for years. There doesn't seem to be much interest in implementing it, though. Neither MDN nor caniuse.com knows about the feature. :/\nIf you want to use it today, leverage PostCSS and the Custom Media plugin. That's better than nothing, but hey... can we have custom media queries, please?\nEdits and comments\n\n\nAdam Argyle filed a Chromium feature request for it now. 🎉 You can give your vote here.\nMarco Biedermann pointed out that custom media queries are part of the postcss-present-env stage 1.\n\n\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",

You might know that you can check for user preferences using media queries.\nLet's take the prefers-reduced-motion media query as an example.👇\n@media screen and (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {\n  /* stop all these animations */\n}\n\nYou can use the prefers-reduced-motion query to stop animating elements when users prefer not to see motion and animations (learn more about why you should do that on CSS-Tricks). The query can have two different values: no-preference and reduce.\nIf you have used this media query before, you might know that you can also use its short variant and drop the reduce value. The media query will behave the same.\n@media screen and (prefers-reduced-motion) {\n  /* stop all…",

          "description": "I came across a post by Simon Willison that described how to use the tesseract CLI command to extract text from an image. I took the opportunity to fiddle around with some shell scripting and added an extract-text-from-image command to my dotfiles. It uses tesseract to analyze an image, creates a txt file with the embedded text, copies the ebedded text to the clipboard, and deletes the txt file again.\nThe tesseract command was available on my machine. If it's not available on yours, install it via your favorite package manager.\nFind extract-image-from-texts last iteration below:\nfunction extract-text-from-image() {\n  if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then\n    echo \"Please specify the file you want to scan.\";\n    echo \"  -> extract-text-from-image /some/path/image.png\";\n    return 1;\n  fi\n\n  TARGET_DIR=$(dirname \"$1\");\n  FILENAME=$(basename -- \"$1\");\n  FILENAME_WITHOUT_EXTENSION=\"${FILENAME%.*}\";\n\n  tesseract \"$1\" \"$TARGET_DIR/$FILENAME_WITHOUT_EXTENSION\" -l eng txt || return 1;\n  pbcopy < \"$TARGET_DIR/$FILENAME_WITHOUT_EXTENSION.txt\";\n  rm \"$TARGET_DIR/$FILENAME_WITHOUT_EXTENSION.txt\";\n  echo \"🎉 Text copied to clipboard!\";\n}\n\nI don't think I'll use this command daily, but I'm amazed by this piece of CLI magic.\nEdit: Wesley Martin shared the macOCR project with me and it's also worth a look!\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",
