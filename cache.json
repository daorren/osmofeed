And while I could run all of them with the node binary (node create-thumbnails.js), I prefer to remove the file extension and make the scripts executables (./create-thumbnails). This approach saves characters, and makes me feel like a hacker!\nMy steps to create an executable are:\nRemove the .js file extension (mv create-thumbnails.js create-thumbnails).\nMake the file executable  (chmod 744 create-thumbnails).\nAdd a shebang (#!/usr/bin/env node) to signal that the executing shell should use the node binary.\nEt voilà, you just created a Node.js executable!\nThis approach has served me well for CommonJS-based scripts using the require function.

It's hands-down the :has() pseudo-class for me, because :has() flips CSS around, and content will finally be able to influence styling!\nDave Rupert published a post including this :has() selector to style the first element but only if it's included in an odd-numbered list.\nBut there's a surprise: you don't even need :has() for this. Temani Afif shared that you can do it with nth-last-of-type, too.\nAnd while we're at it, do you remember this snippet? It's a CSS quantity query to select li elements, but only if there are three or more list elements. 🤯\nI'm blown away by all this CSS magic, but I wonder how wild and complicated future CSS will become.
