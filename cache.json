And he hit the nail on the head with \"Browsers, JSON, and FormData\".\nSo what's the current state of the web?\nIt's bloated with truckloads of JavaScript, and APIs power everything. APIs won't go anywhere, but we're all working on reducing JavaScript.\nTo drop some code while still relying on APIs, there are two options:\nWe need either 1) more APIs that speak FormData, or 2) browsers that speak JSON.\nOn point, Jim! On point. 💯\nThink of it: isn't it wild that JSON APIs only work with JavaScript and Ajax because JSON requests aren't supported in HTML?\nTo put it bluntly: there’s no progressive enhancement if all your APIs only accept JSON payloads directly from the browser.\nWith the rise of all these APIs, we either have to rely on client-side JavaScript to talk to APIs directly or pipe everything through a serverless function. And we're so used to doing this that we don't even question it anymore.\nThe web platform is entirely broken in that sense if you ask me. And it's funny, because Jim dug up a spec that aimed to bring JSON into HTML. 😲\n<form enctype='application/json'>\n  <input name='name' value='Bender'>\n  <select name='hind'>\n    <option selected>Bitable</option>\n    <option>Kickable</option>\n  </select>\n  <input type='checkbox' name='shiny' checked>\n</form>\n\nUnfortunately, the spec went nowhere...\nBut think of it: with JSON built into HTML forms, and View transitions coming up (formerly known as Shared Element Transistions), the web could really catch up and become the platform it needs to be these days.\nAnyways, head over to Jim's blog; it's a good one, I promise!\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",

          "description": "I've been reading one of Temani Afif's CSS magic posts and discovered a clip-path CSS trick I wasn't aware of.\nclip-path allows you to clip an element in various ways. You can use geometric shapes like circles and SVG paths. It's pretty cool!\n.element {\n  clip-path: circle(50px at 0 100px);\n  clip-path: path(\n    \"M0.5,1 C0.5,1,0,0.7,0,0.3 A0.25,0.25,1,1,1,1,0.3 C1,0.7,0.5,1,0.5,1 Z\"\n  );\n}\n\nBut to be fair, I haven't used clip-path extensively, because a) my projects aren't that fancy, and b) I can't be bothered with creating complicated SVG paths.\nBut then there's also polygon. With polygon you can define clipping pointed with relative percentages. Handy!\n.element {\n  clip-path: polygon(50% 0%, 100% 50%, 50% 100%, 0% 50%);\n}\n\nAnd Temani shared that you can even define points outside the 100% range, too! 😲\nIt’s a little known fact that clip-path accepts values outside the 0%-100% range, which allows us to create “overflowing” shapes.\nThis detail is something I could get my head around to create some custom corners!\n[Interactive component: visit the article to see it...]\nThank you, Temani!\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",
