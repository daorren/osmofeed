          "description": "Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is \"experimental\" due to these caveats:\n\nThis feature is currently only available through custom template.\niTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be \"hh:mm:ss\" or \"mm:ss\" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.\nNo image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.\nYou can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.\nFixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.\nThank you @Zenigata",

          "description": "If you're using EcmaScript modules, you probably know the problem that you can't \"just\" import JSON files. To import and load a JSON file in an ES module, you have to do a \"window.fetch dance\" to request the file and parse it yourself. It's not great...\nBut there's hope! According to chromestatus.com, JSON Modules are shipping in Chrome 91. I gave it a quick try, and surprisingly, the following JavaScript code does not work.\n<script type=\"module\">\n  import data from \"./data.json\";\n  console.log(data);\n</script>\n\nIt throws the following exception in Chrome 91:\nFailed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript module script but the server responded with a MIME type of \"application/json\". Strict MIME type checking is enforced for module scripts per HTML spec.\nI didn't have a detailed look at the spec discussion about this topic, but apparently, the new syntax to import JSON Modules is the following. 😲\nimport data from \"./data.json\" assert { type: \"json\" };\n\nconsole.log(data);\n\nThat's quite something, and I have to do some reading about it. But hey, anything that makes it easier to import JSON is more than welcome!\nAnd when there's a solution in Chrome, it can't be long until it ships in Node.js because importing JSON files in Node ES modules is not great either. 🙈\nEdit: Axel Rauschmayer shared that JSON import are based on import assertions and you can read more about it on his blog.\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",

          "description": "This post is a quick reference for my future self. I implemented the eleventy cache assets plugin to speed up my local development last weekend. This site is based on API data from several sources, and unfortunately, local development became terribly slow. It was time for some optimization. The problem was that the local build process fetched all the API data on every file change and local rebuild.\nThe eleventy cache plugin helps here. It caches data across builds and writes the API data into files in a .cache directory. When the site rebuilds, the cached data is reused, and no APIs will be called during the build process.\nTo make the plugin work in a remote environment such as Netlify, it needs the .cache directory to be available. This behavior led to the problem that I had to check in the .cache directory but needed to ignore all the included files.\nI ran into this exact problem many times, and it always takes me several attempts to get it right. Here's the solution that worked for me.\nFirst, add the directory to your local project and place a .gitignore file in it.\n.cache\n  |_ .gitignore\n\nThen, paste the following configuration into the .gitignore file in the directory you want to check in.\n# File: .cache/.gitignore\n# Ignore everything in this directory\n*\n# Except for this file\n!.gitignore\n\nAnd voilà! Commit the .gitignore file at folder-you-want-to-check-in/.gitignore, and that's it! The directory is now available in git and files in this directory will be ignored.\nIt's to point out that .gitignore files work in sub-directories and allow you to configure git on a sub-directory level. And that's pretty handy!\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",
