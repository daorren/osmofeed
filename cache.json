There's Load, the holy Speed Index or web vitals such as LCP (largest contentful paint).\nHarry just made a case for considering monitoring DomContentLoad, too! It's a good piece on browser events and how to get your hands on improving web performance.\nAnd while reading it, I discovered another browser event that I probably have known about but left my memory — DomInteractive.\n[DomInteractive] is the moment the browser has finished parsing all synchronous DOM work: your HTML and all blocking scripts it encountered on the way. Basically, the browser is now at the </html> tag. The browser is ready to run your deferred JavaScript.\nThe DomInteractive event can come in handy when evaluating your JS payloads' execution time. But I won't repeat Harry's insights here, so head over to his blog. The post is a nice deep dive!\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",
