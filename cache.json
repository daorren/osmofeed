          "description": "htmx has been pretty loud lately because it moves functionality, like swapping out DOM elements into declarative HTML. Love it or hate it, I think it's a \"fresh\" approach to the overcomplicated world of JS frameworks.\n<script src=\"https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@1.9.10\"></script>\n<!-- have a button POST a click via AJAX -->\n<button hx-post=\"/clicked\" hx-swap=\"outerHTML\">\n  Click Me\n</button>\n\nAdd the 14kb compressed file to your sites and create dynamic interactions. Everything's just a hx-whatever attribute away. Sweet!\nCould you do similar things with less JavaScript? And while I wouldn't recommend using htmz in production, it does some HTML-swapping magic with 176 JS bytes. How? With very creative iframe usage.\n<iframe hidden name=htmz onload=\"setTimeout(()=>document.querySelector(this.contentWindow.location.hash||null)?.replaceWith(...this.contentDocument.body.childNodes))\"></iframe>\n\n<!-- Loads /flower.html onto #my-element -->\n<a href=\"/flower.html#my-element\" target=htmz>Flower</a>\n\nIs the project a joke? Sorta â€” maybe not. But whether we talk about htmx or htmz or whatever comes next, it becomes clear that we're lacking some HTML primitives. But maybe frames were already good enough? #oldIsNew ðŸ˜…\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",
