          "description": "I'm maintaining a project built with Tailwind at work. I'm no daily Tailwinder, but usually, I manage just fine. But recently, a trivial task took me quite some time to get right. I wanted to rotate an SVG icon depending on the details element's :open state.\nGetting started with Tailwind is straightforward (a CSS property just maps to a class name, right?), but I still have to wrap my head around advanced features like class-based element relationships.\nHow would you achieve the following CSS in Tailwind?\ndetails:open svg {\n  rotate: 0.5turn;\n}\n\nOption 1 â€” don't use Tailwind and go vanilla CSS\n\nWhen googling around, you'll find the advice to \"just use\" CSS and import a CSS file somewhere. Sure, this works, but what's the point of this? Tailwind promises to solve the CSS maintenance problemâ€¦",

But as far as I can tell, even though it's uncommon it's still a perfectly valid HTML attribute. So, how would you query this element?\nYou surely could use the good old document.getElementById()...\nconsole.log(document.getElementById('#')); // <div id=\"#\">...\n\nThis works, but I rarely use getElementById because it limits me to select elements via an id. Duh! ðŸ˜…\ndocument.querySelector, on the other hand, is more flexible and allows any DOM element to be queried with a CSS selector.\nBut can you select this \"hash id element\" with a CSS selector using querySelector? Turns out you can't.\nconsole.log(document.querySelector('##'));\n// SyntaxError: â€¦",
