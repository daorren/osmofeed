They include hand-written shell scripts to create symlinks, download all desktop apps and CLI tools, and get my preferred system settings in place. But overall, they've become a Frankenstein over time because many random scripts are doing random things. And obviously, I failed to document what's going on properly.\nSure, scripts have to run to install stuff, but for config file management, most solutions I've seen seemed too complicated to keep some files in sync. And I really don't want to use a dotfile framework to pull some configuration files.\nWhat if there is a way to tweak Git and track all the .*rc and config files?\n\"Dotfiles management\" describes Git magic to track all files somewhere on your machine from a single .git repository. Yes, your read that right. Any file and anywhere.\nalias dotfiles='git --git-dir=/home/mx/.dotfiles --work-tree=/'\n\nThat's right; there's a .git folder somewhere on your machine (/home/mx/.dotfiles in the example), and it'll track all the files no matter where they're located, thanks to the --work-tree argument. Then there's no symlink dance!\nWith some additional configuration, you can add and sync files across machines without scripts using dotfiles add or dotfiles commit. It's all just plain Git.\nThis dotfiles approach is by far the smartest I've seen, and I'll definitely give it a shot when I fiddle with my system config the next time.\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",

          "description": "I'm continuing my journey of learning TypeScript, and it's a wild ride. Sometimes I feel like I have things under control, but other times, I'm looking at a type definition at work, and all I can do is scratch my head in confusion. It'll be a long journey!\nToday I discovered a somewhat basic but very useful feature that's in TS since 3.4 (released in 2019). That's a century in web development, but hey, I'm still starting out!\nHow to narrow types with const assertions\n\nLet's look at a trivial example.\nconst resource = {id: '123'};\n\nif (resource.id === '234') {\n  console.log('yay!');\n}\n\nIf you look at it, you'll probably see that there's no way this code logs out yay! because the resource.id isn't changed to 234. But TypeScript doesn't know that, and if you inspect the resulting type, you'll find that resource.id is just a string. And that does make sense because it doesn't matter if you declare an object with the const keyword; you can still change the properties as you like.\nBut what if you want to treat the object as truly immutable? Turns out, you can narrow types and explicitly tell TypeScript that resource won't change with two words — as const.\nconst resource = {id: '123'} as const;\n\nif (resource.id === '234') {\n  console.log('yay');\n}\n\nAnd voilà — look at this extra level of type safety! 👏\nNow that TypeScript knows that resource is immutable, it narrows the property type from string to 123, and it complains if you're trying to alter the constant object. That's pretty handy for all sorts of operations!\nThe TypeScript docs are a quick read if you want to learn more.\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",

To be fair, there are fewer quirks than ten years ago, but some things would still make great language additions. One thing that would make a lot of sense is required function parameters.\nAssume you have a function that defines required arguments. And you really really want to make sure the function is called with the correct arguments by throwing an error.\nHere's what you might do:\nfunction doSomethingWithAThing(theThing) {\n  if (typeof theThing === \"undefined\") {\n    throw new Error(\"theThing is required\");\n  }\n}\n\nThat's quite a bit of code for such a simple thing.\nUnfortunately, you can't do something like this in JavaScript ...\nfunction doSomethingWithAThing(\n  theThing = throw new Error(\"theThing Is Undefined\")\n) {\n  // ...\n}\n\n... because JavaScript doesn't like it.\nPeter Kröner published a handy snippet that he carries around from project to project. The post is in German, so here's the English gist of it.\nFirst, define a fail function.\nfunction fail(reason, ErrorConstructor = Error) {\n  throw new ErrorConstructor(reason);\n}\n\nAnd second... use it. 🫣\nBy restructuring the code and transforming the error throwing portion into an expression, you can immediately throw in case a function is called without the required parameters.\nfunction doSomethingWithAThing(\n  theThing = fail('theThing Is Undefined')\n) {\n  // ...\n}\n\nWhat a beautiful sort of one-line workaround.\nThanks Peter!\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",

No wrapper functions either. One of the contributors noted on HN: \"It uses the same mechanisms that Cgo does to switch to the system stack and then call the C code. Purego just avoids having to need a C toolchain to cross compile code that calls into C from Go.\"\nEbitengine \n\n\n  \n  \nGo Quirks and Intermediate Tricks — This isn’t the best formatted post, but you might pick up a few things from this list (which, handily, has code examples for each item).\nEfron Licht \n\n\n  \n  \nFree from O’Reilly: Build Resilient Apps in Go — Learn to build cloud-na…",

Profile-Guided Optimization (PGO) feeds runtime profiles to the compiler to optimize the binary based on usage. Go 1.20 includes initial support for this, so try this with your apps and (hopefully) see some perf gains.\nMichael Pratt \n\n\n  \n  \nTransparent Telemetry for Open Source Projects — It's an emotive topic, but Russ puts forth a concept of ‘transparent telemetry’, a privacy-sensitive approach to gathering usage data in the Go toolchain to help Go library devs, the core team, and others.
