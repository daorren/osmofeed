This post is my SVG filter bookmark, which I'll extend over time.\nAn SVG filter to cut out black pixels\n\nArtur Bień's post \"Using HTML elements as CSS masks\" triggered this post because he shared a very fancy SVG filter to mask out black pixels.\n[Interactive component: visit the article to see it...]\nIf you play around with it, you'll discover that it only masks \"real black\" pixels. Still — it's a wild filter!\nA natural shadow SVG filter\n\nI love a good box-shadow, but one problem with CSS shadows is that they only displays a single color. Wouldn't it be nice if you could create shadows that pick up a DOM elements color?\nGuess what? SVG can do natural lighting shadows, too!\n[Interactive component: visit the article to see it...]\nUnfortunately, it looks like Safari still has issues with this filter, but hey... the world won't go down if Safari users won't see a colorful shadow. 🤷‍♂️\n\n      \n        \n          \n        \n      \n      \nA fancy noise / dither SVG filter\n\nI found this effect on Robin Rendle's blog, and I love the rough and artsy feeling of added SVG noise.\n[Interactive component: visit the article to see it...]\nNote that this effect combines three SVG filters that are rotated via a @keyframes animation.\n\nIf you have other SVG in your toolbox, shoot them my way!

What if there's one annoying 3rd party script messing with your events and you have to keep it?\nToday I learned about a nuclear option to remove all existing event listeners.\nconst button = document.querySelector('button);\n\n// replace the element with a copy of itself\n// and nuke all the event listeners\nbutton.replaceWith(button.cloneNode(true));\n\nBoom! And that's it — replacing a DOM element with a cloned version of itself removes all previously registered event handlers.

In their words, Twoslash is:\nmarkdown code samples powered by the syntax engine of Visual Studio Code\nmixed with the TypeScript compiler’s information.\nAnd that's pretty incredible, because it's also able to validate your code and show possible Typescript errors.\nts\n\ninterface Person {\n  name: string\n}\n \ninterface Person {\n  age: number\n}\n \n// `Person` is now merged and expects `name` and `age`\nconst p: Person = {\nProperty 'name' is missing in type '{ age: number; }' but required in type 'Person'.2741Property 'name' is missing in type '{ age: number; }' but required in type 'Person'.\n  age: 99\n}\n\n\nYou can let Twoslash do its job; if your snippets aren't correct, it'll complain and error out (unless you tell it that you expect an error like above).\nAnd because it uses the VS Code type checker, it works for JavaScript snippets, too!\njs\n\nconst a = {\n  joo: 'test'\n};\n \nconsole.log(a.foo);\nProperty 'foo' does not exist on type '{ joo: string; }'.2339Property 'foo' does not exist on type '{ joo: string; }'.\n\nAnd then, you can use some fancy markdown syntax to inspect variables and even show possible auto-completion values.\njs\n\nconst a = {\n  test: 'test'\n  testTwo: 'test'\n  testThree: 'test'\n};\n \nconsole.log(a.te\n                \ntest\ntestThree\ntestTwo\n\n \n \nconsole.log(a);\n           \nconst a: {\n    test: string;\n    testTwo: string;\n    testThree: string;\n}\n\n\nWild! 🤯\nI'm not entirely convinced I'll use Twoslash for every code snippet on the blog, but for TypeScript snippets — heck yeah!\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",
