          "description": "I just had a look at the current Chrome DevTools experiments and enabled three handy new features. Let's have a look!\nHow to enable Chrome experiments\n\nFirst, how do you enable Chrome experiments?\nYou can either hit the little gear icons in the top-right corner and navigate to \"Experiments\". As a heavy keyboard user, I preview the shortcut way: open the command palette with CMD + Shift + p and go directly to the experiments menu.\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n            \nLook at all these possibly upcoming Chrome DevTools features and play around with them. That's why they're there!\nCSS Overview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n            \nThere are many CSS analysis tools out there, but having them right in your developer tools is super handy. The CSS overview lists defined colors and media queries, used fonts and useless CSS declarations. It's time to clean up your CSS!\nWarnings about low contrast text\n\n\n\n\n          \n            \nLow contrast text is one of the most common accessibility issues. Tools like Lighthouse check for these when you scan your site, but wouldn't it be great if the DevTools would tell you about issues right away? I (and the Chrome DevTools folks) think so, too, and that's why you can enable \"Contrast issue reporting\" to see warnings in your console. 💯\nA new font editor tool\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n            \nI always found it hard to define and style custom fonts. The new font editor helps with that and allows to change font settings with a visual UI!\nI love all this new DevTools functionality and can't wait to see what's next!\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",

          "description": "I still define my CSS colors in hex values. 💪 rgb(), rgba(), hsl() and hsla() are valuable CSS functions, but it's so cumbersome to convert hex values (#34aa44) to numbers or percentages. That's why I never adopted the color functions.\nThe spec even includes a section explaining how to convert RGB to HSL and vice versa.\nMy rare usage is why I missed that the CSS Color Module Level 4 spec made rgba() and hsla() redundant.\nThe specification introduced two changes:\nrgb()/hsl() accept alpha values.\nColor functions accept space-separared values.\nWith rgb()/hsl() accepting transparency values, hsla() and rgba() became legacy functions and are now aliases for rgb()/hsl().\nIf you worry about browser support, check MDN. rgb()/hsl() transparency values are well supported!\nThe second edition is a new space-separated syntax, that improves readability:\n/* evolution of the rgb function with transparency */\nrgba(255, 255, 255, 50%)\nrgba(255 255 255 / 50%)\nrgb(255 255 255 / 50%)\n\n/* evolution of the hsl function with transparency */\nhsla(235, 100%, 50%, 50%) \nhsla(235 100% 50% / 100%)\nhsl(235 100% 50% / 100%)\n\nThese two new features made color handling easier! You don't have to worry about color functions that do or don't support transparency, and the space/slash syntax highlights seperates values and makes it easier to read.

          "description": "Today I learned that the color theme I use (Yi color theme) does not support semantic syntax highlighting. Semantic what?\nSemantic syntax highlighting makes sure your source code is not only beautifully colored, but that used the colors are logical, too.\nAfter learning about this feature, I discovered that my editor's syntax highlighting is very confusing. Functions, methods, arguments and parameters change their color from line to line. I wonder how I never noticed this chaos!\nBut thanks to VS Code, you can enforce semantic highlighting using the editor.semanticHighlighting.enabled setting (read more in the VS Code docs) so that syntactic tokens don't change colors constantly! 🎉\n\n          \n            \nI turned it on for now. Let's find out if code is easier to grasp or if my brain needs unlogical always changing colors. 🤷‍♂️\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",

          "description": "If you're a tab hoarder like me, you probably noticed that browsers discard inactive browser tabs to save resources eventually. The tabs are still open and visible in the browser UI but are put to sleep and only brought back and reloaded on tab focus.\nToday I found out that there are ways to control if tabs should be discarded and even discard tabs yourself.\nIn Chrome/Edge navigate to about://discards (about is a shorthand to use the same protocol in Chrome and Edge and find all open tabs ready to be controlled.\n\n\n\n\n          \n            \nAll tab entries include an Urgent Discard button to put them to sleep, and you can configure if a particular tab should be auto-discardable, too.\nSimilar functionality will be included in Firefox 94 at about:unloads. The page provides insights into the allocated tab resources and allows you to \"unload\" them one at a time. What's different here is that you can't decide which tabs to unload because the \"unload\" button only discards tabs in a prioritized order. 🤷‍♂️\n\n\n\n          \n            \nAll in all, tab discarding is a handy functionality, and I'll try out discarding all tabs the next time I'm running low on memory or battery. (I can't lose all the tabs...)\nBut configuring \"auto discard\" for each tab, I won't mess with it. Browsers don't discard active tabs like a YouTube music video or the Slack UI, and they're probably smarter at figuring out when an active tab consumes too many resources than I am. 😉\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",
