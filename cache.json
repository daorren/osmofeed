          "description": "Did Chris just publish a post and unveil the solution to a long-lasting CSS problem almost in a side sentence? It seems like it!\nWhat of the many are we walking about? We're talking about animating an element's height from 0 to something (auto).\nAnimated grid rows\n\nNot too long ago, browsers shipped animatable CSS grid columns and rows which you could use to fly in a side menu or do fancy stuff like Michelle Barker. 👇\n by Michelle Barker (@michellebarker)\n  on CodePen.\n\nI've never considered using animated grid rows to hide grid cells, though.\nHere's the trick to toggle an element's height:\ndefine a grid element\ndefine a single grid row with 0fr\nadd a transition for grid-template-rows\nset overflow: hidden to the one element inside the grid\nredefine the grid-template-rows to be 1fr with an open class\n.grid {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-rows: 0fr;\n  transition: grid-template-rows 0.5s ease-in-out;\n}\n\n.grid.open {\n  grid-template-rows: 1fr;\n}\n\n.grid-inner {\n  overflow: hidden;\n}\n\nAnd voila! You can now transition an element's height, and it doesn't use any hardcoded values – toggle a class and call it a day! CSS Grid figures out all the rest.\n[Interactive component: visit the article to see it...]\nI'm blown away by this!\nAnd sure, to Chris' point, it'd be nice to have an easier way to animate element heights, but I'll take this approach for now! Thanks Chris! 💯\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",
