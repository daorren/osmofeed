          "description": "JavaScript is always good for a surprise, isn't it?\nNicholas C. Zakas published a discovery that made my head spin. Do you know the array method every?\nThis is how MDN describes what it does:\nThe every() method of Array instances tests whether all elements in the array pass the test implemented by the provided function. It returns a Boolean value.\nCool, that makes sense.\nconst collection = ['great', 'nope', 'great'];\nconst allItemsAreGreat = collection.every((item) => item === 'great'); // false\n\nBut now, see what happens when you use every with an empty array.\n[].every((item) => item === 'great'); // true\n[].every((item) => item !== 'great'); // true\n\nWhoops?! I didn't expect that every() will tell me that every item matches my condition if there are none. That's not how my brain works.\nWhen using the array method, you have to flip around your mindset. Here's Nicholas:\nI’d suggest changing the way you read every() calls when you come across them. Instead of reading every() as “does every item in this array match this condition?” read it as, “is there any item in this array that doesn’t match this condition?”.\nAnd it gets every weirder. Check the results for an empty array with some().\n[].some((item) => item === 'great'); // false\n[].some((item) => item !== 'great'); // false\n\nOh boy... Why do the array methods behave that way? The answer is Math, and if you want to dive deeper, check Nicholas' post. 💯\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",

It's the longest break since I started Web Weekly, and I can't say that this doesn't bug me, but I needed the break. Life was super busy; I moved, traveled countries to speak at a conference, and then got sick for a few days. It's been a ride...\nBut it's all good, and I'm back! Thank you to all the people who checked in with me. 💙\nLet's get back to business!\nShould HTML allow us to ship responsive videos? How can you optimize your fetch calls? And is there an easy way to escape CSS classes in JavaScript?\nThis week's Web Weekly includes all the answers and much more. Enjoy!\nPeople were raving about barrel files this week.
