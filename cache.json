Yeah, same here.\nSurprisingly, JSON, in its initial spec, did allow comments, but comment support was removed for three reasons:\nPeople put parsing instructions into comments breaking portability across platforms and languages.\nComments introduced complexity that might not be needed for a data format.\nThe JSON creators wanted it to be compatible with early YAML versions.\nIt's a bummer because JSON outgrew its serial data use case, and it's widespread to have JSON config files these days. :/\nPawel Grzybek pointed out that the lack of comments and other features led to the JSON5 spec, which aimed to be a JSON extension suitable for config files and was adopted by VS Code and many other software products today.\nIf you want to learn more, here's why comments were removed on YouTube.\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",

          "description": "A month ago, I was searching for a CSS generator to create a CSS grid background for a blog post component. 👇\nI knew creating this CSS effect wouldn't be too hard, but fiddling with CSS gradients is not my strong suit. Unfortunately, my Google foo failed me. And if your search terms include \"CSS\" and \"grid\" you'll get only tutorials to use and create \"CSS grids\".  🤦‍♂️\nThe only solution was to tweak random Codepens, and I spent a good half an hour creating vertical and horizontal lines in CSS.\nSo! If you, dear reader, are on the hunt for a quick CSS background grid generator, you reached your final destination!\nHere's my contribution to the internet. 👇\n[Interactive component: visit the article to see it...]\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",

          "description": "Suppose you're using Google Services like Gmail; you can log into other services with Google Sign-In. That's great if you're logged in all the time and don't mind Google watching every one of your moves.\nIf you're using Gmail and Chrome, privacy's a lost cause anyways, but let's not get into this topic.\nNow, even though I use Gmail, I prefer to sign in with Email/Password combinations and let my password manager do its magic. And with this setup, I don't need yet another modal begging for attention. 👇\nThanks to Ricky Mondello, today I learned you can disable Google's Sign-In nudges in your account settings!\nThank goodness — less pop-ups are more fun!\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",
