          "description": "I just cleaned up all the open tabs in my browser and discovered a Tweet from Jamie Kyle (if you open it, yes, I had that tab open for six months 🙈). Jamie described how he implemented a natural shadow component using React and SVG filters. The shadow reflects the element's colors, and they are what give the effect its natural look.\n\n          \n            \nJamie wraps an image into an SVG element and uses SVG filter elements to create the beautiful shadow.\nThat approach got me thinking, a while ago, I published a blog post describing how to inline SVG filters in CSS. It turns out you can apply Jamie's SVG filter without React or wrapping everything in an SVG element. Pure CSS does the job! 🎉\nHere's the CSS class with the inlined SVG filter.\n.natural-shadow {\n  /* inline the SVG filter */\n  filter: url('data:image/svg+xml,\\\n    <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\\\n      <filter id=\"naturalShadow\" x=\"0\" y=\"0\" width=\"2\" height=\"2\">\\\n        <feOffset in=\"SourceGraphic\" dx=\"3\" dy=\"3\" />\\\n        <feGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\"5\" result=\"blur\" />\\\n        <feMerge>\\\n          <feMergeNode in=\"blur\"/>\\\n          <feMergeNode in=\"SourceGraphic\"/>\\\n        </feMerge>\\\n      </filter>\\\n    </svg>#naturalShadow');\n}\n\nWhat's cool about this approach is that the SVG filter is visually applied to the element and its children. You can apply it to a wrapper div such as the one below.\n<div class=\"natural-shadow\">\n  <img src=\"/your-image.png\" alt=\"Your iamge\">\n</div>\n\nSee the result in action. This shadow is done in pure CSS (sort of 🙈). 👇\nAs stated in my previous blog post, Safari seems to have some issues with inlined SVG filters. If you know what's the problem, please let me know!\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",

          "description": "Chris Coyier shared a fascinating post describing a bug that only appeared on low-resolution devices. The post brings up the interesting problem of low-resolution devices. I usually work on a MacBook Pro and a decent monitor so that I rarely see and check the things I build in lower resolutions.\nDeveloper tools offer ways to emulate lower DPR (device pixel ratio), and tools such as dpilove indeed show different resolution values after adjusting the DPR. However, the website still looks sharp and crisp on my MacBook. I wonder if I'm missing something here?\n\n\n\n\n          \n            \nAfter reading Chris' post, I learned that you can enable low-resolution mode when developing on a high-resolution Mac. Open the app information for your browser, tick the box for \"Open in Low Resolution\" and start the application.\n\n\n\n\n          \n            \nWhen you then open the app (my example shows Chrome Canary), you see a clear visual difference. The website is rendered in low resolution, everything is a bit \"blurry\", and even the browser frame and controls are not rendered in sharp retina style anymore.\nThat's good to know for future debugging sessions that deal with device pixel ratio!\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",

          "description": "Accessible form inputs are essential for building an inclusive web. It's no news that input elements should come with a properly describing label. There are two HTML-native approaches to connect a label element with an input element.\n<!-- reference the id of the input element -->\n<label for=\"email\">\n  Your email address\n</label>\n<input type=\"email\" name=\"email\" id=\"email\">\n\n\n<!-- wrap the input element with a label -->\n<label>\n  Your email address\n  <input type=\"email\" name=\"email\">\n</label>\n\nI love the input-wrapping approach because I don't have to invent ids to connect a label with an input. Additionally, it increases the tab/click area of the wrapped input element, making it more accessible with an improved UX!\nIt would be such a beautiful solution if there wouldn't be the usual Frontend problem of supporting countless browsers, devices and assistive technologies such as screen readers.\nApparently, the Dragon speech recognition software is not supporting wrapping labels (Dragon product page), which means you still have to use for/id when wrapping your inputs.\n<!-- wrapped input + for/id connection -->\n<label for=\"email\">\n  Your email address\n  <input type=\"email\" name=\"email\" id=\"email\">\n</label>\n\nAnd that's it. This quick post's purpose is purely to have the links above at hand in the future, so that's it already. 🙈\nIf you want to read more about labels and input, have a look at Adrian Roselli's post My Priority of Methods for Labeling a Control.\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",

I don't have an iPhone, but I can imagine that the zoom interaction is pretty distracting when you \"just\" want to fill out a form.\nWhy is Safari zooming in for controls that have a font size less than 16px? 16px is the default body font size for most browsers and is what you get after declaring font-size: 100%; on :root. 16px is the smalled accessible font size according to accessibility resources.\nJosh's discovery is a fact that'll come in handy in the future because I had a few discussions about font sizes lately. Some folks tend to prefer small and light grey fonts – the less readable, the better. 🙈\nI doubt that the iOS zoom argument will be the game-changer in these discussions, but the more arguments for accessible web design I have the more likely I can convince someone! 🎉\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",
