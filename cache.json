What if there's one annoying 3rd party script messing with your events and you have to keep it?\nToday I learned about a nuclear option to remove all existing event listeners.\nconst button = document.querySelector('button);\n\n// replace the element with a copy of itself\n// and nuke all the event listeners\nbutton.replaceWith(button.cloneNode(true));\n\nBoom!

The Go team has also built a tool, gorebuild, to prove the feature works as intended.\nRuss Cox \n\n\n  \n  \nCgo Performance in Go 1.21 — Cgo makes it possible for Go packages to call C code and is commonly used to provide Go apps with access to the larger world of C-based libraries. Shane doesn’t want to argue about Cgo's pros and cons here but does make the case that its performance is good and the overhead is insignificant in most cases.\nShane Hansen \n\n\n  \n  \nCertificate-Based MFA, RBAC, and SSO with Tele…",

If you didn't get an issue of Go Weekly in the past few weeks, don't worry, I was on vacation. I'm technically on vacation for a couple more days but didn't want too many issues to pass by, so here we are. 😁\n__\nPeter Cooper and the Cooperpress team\n\n\n    \n    \n\nGo Weekly\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \nOn Backward Compatibility, Go 1.21, and.. Go 2? — If backwards compatibility sounds boring, “boring can be good,” says Russ, who has written about some of the “important work we shipped in Go 1.21 to keep Go boring” when it comes to ensuring your programs continue to compile in the face of changes to Go’s tooling.
