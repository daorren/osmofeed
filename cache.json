          "description": "Did Chris just publish a post and unveil the solution to a long-lasting CSS problem almost in a side sentence? It seems like it!\nWhat of the many are we walking about? We're talking about animating an element's height from 0 to something (auto).\nAnimated grid rows\n\nNot too long ago, browsers shipped animatable CSS grid columns and rows which you could use to fly in a side menu or do fancy stuff like Michelle Barker. 👇\n by Michelle Barker (@michellebarker)\n  on CodePen.\n\nI've never considered using animated grid rows to hide grid cells, though.\nHere's the trick to toggle an element's height:\ndefine a grid element\ndefine a single grid row with 0fr\nadd a transition for grid-template-rows\nset overflow: hidden to the one element inside the grid\nredefine the grid-template-rows to be 1fr with an open class\n.grid {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-rows: 0fr;\n  transition: grid-template-rows 0.5s ease-in-out;\n}\n\n.grid.open {\n  grid-template-rows: 1fr;\n}\n\n.grid-inner {\n  overflow: hidden;\n}\n\nAnd voila! You can now transition an element's height, and it doesn't use any hardcoded values – toggle a class and call it a day! CSS Grid figures out all the rest.\n[Interactive component: visit the article to see it...]\nI'm blown away by this!\nAnd sure, to Chris' point, it'd be nice to have an easier way to animate element heights, but I'll take this approach for now!

If you don't know Raycast, it's a macOS Spotlight replacement and the OS-level command bar is very good!\nI use Raycast primarily to navigate all the apps on my machine, place windows on different monitors and expand snippets. ;es for example, expands automatically to my email address. Whether in my browser, mail app or Slack, my email address or often used phrases are automagically expanded to save some keystrokes.\nBut I must admit, the docs on auto-expansion could be better, and someone asked me how I set this functionality up. So here we go!\nThe native snippet extension\n\nRaycast comes with a native snippet extension to create and search all your snippets from within Raycast itself.\nI'm not using it to search my snippets, because I primarily auto-expand things. And to enable auto-expansion, you must look at the overall snippet configuration.\n\"Enable Snippet Expansion\" is the magic trick. After you enable this setting, use the \"Create Snippet\" or \"Edit snippet\" command via the Raycast command bar and define a name, the expansion and the character combination triggering it (Keyword).\nAnd that's it!\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",
