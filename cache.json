My blog has turned into my own little knowledge base over the years. I don't mind publishing quick thoughts or notes with five sentences. 🤷‍♂️ If people find value in it, great! If not, also great because I posted it for my future self.\nI often don't remember solutions or facts, but I remember when I made a note on my blog and read my own posts multiple times a week. I write things down to remember.\nAs Marco Heine puts it in \"Just hit publish\":\nIt doesn’t have to be perfect. It has to be on here. That’s the main goal.\nStrongly agree!\nBut it's not only about creating a sec…",
