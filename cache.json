Or make a great impression when you onboard a new job?\nAll the answers and much more are included in this week's Web Weekly!\nOur friends at Google released a new WebDev term at Google.io — \"the baseline\". Usually, I'm no fan of new tech lingo (MPA anyone? 😅), but I can get behind this one.\nThe baseline describes features supported in the current and previous versions of all major browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and  Safari). So that it replaces the mouthful \"feature ABC is cross-browser supported\".\nAnd the term isn't only a Google effort but a collaboration of Apple, Microsoft, and Mozilla. Get ready because we can expect many new baseline widgets like th…",

          "description": "Do you remember Facebook's hugely popular like button? A quick-to-add JS snippet enabled site owners to implement Facebook functionality, and the social media giant started tracking people across the web.\nIt's been wild times, and luckily, things are different today. People are more privacy aware, (some) browsers started blocking all these trackers, and I stopped using Facebook years ago.\nBut I do watch many YouTube videos. And this made me think: how does YouTube treat privacy when you embed a video?\nI was delighted to learn about YouTube's privacy-enhanced embed mode!\nIf you turn it on, the iframe source changes from youtube.com/embed/[ID] to youtube-nocookie.com/embed/[ID]. That's pretty cool!\nBut unfortunately, I just stumbled upon Jason Grigsby's disappointment about the feature.\nSo what's up?\nFirst, the domain youtube-nocookie.com seemed to have been a cute developer idea until the business decided that dropping all cookies isn't great for the ad monetization model. youtube-nocookie.com does not mean no cookies.\n\"We won't store user info unless you interact with the embed\".\nOuch... but fair; YouTube doesn't hide what they're doing here. youtube-nocookie.com isn't more than an unfortunate domain choice, but hey, we've all bought silly domains at some point, right?\nBut it's not okay that the explainer claims that the embed only starts storing user info after an interaction.\nI just tried it out, and look what I've found in my localstorage. 🤦‍♂️\nSo much about, \"we won't store user info unless you play the video\". Not cool, YouTube. Really not cool!\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",

This is something you can comfortably ignore in 2023.” Quite!\nBen E. C.
