It's just not easy to read. And additionally, the condition becomes even harder to read if there are more fruits and you have to chain all these logical ORs.\nAnd now look at what Chris advises to use instead:\nif (['apple', 'strawberry'].includes(fruit)) {\n  // ...\n}\n\n// or even place things in a variable \n// to make it even clearer\nif (deliciousFruits.includes(fruit)) {\n  // ...\n}\n\nIs that readable code, or what? 😲 The condition even includes the word includes to make it easier to understand! 👏 It's a tiny change that improves readability tremendously.\nI'll adopt this pattern from now on!

          "description": "reduce() is one of these underrated Array methods that can be tremendously useful to accumulate array items. Define an initial value, iterate over all array items and define a callback function to form a combined result.\nThe beauty: each callback's return value is provided to the next entry callback so that you can sum numbers or regroup the array entries inside of an object.\nreduce((previousValue, currentValue) => {\n  /* ... */\n});\nreduce((previousValue, currentValue, currentIndex) => {\n  /* ... */\n});\nreduce((previousValue, currentValue, currentIndex, array) => {\n  /* ... */\n});\nreduce((previousValue, currentValue, currentIndex, array) => {\n  /* ... */\n}, initialValue);\n\nAnd after all these years, looking at these recude callback signatures, I discovered that the initial value is optional. 😲\nLet's look at an example of summing numbers.\n// sum all numbers in the array\n// start with `0`\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].reduce((previousValue, currentValue) => {\n  console.log(previousValue);\n  // the return value will be the next `previousValue`\n  return previousValue + currentValue;\n}, 0); // 15\n\n// Output in the console:\n// 0 \n// 1 \n// 3\n// 6\n// 10 \n// 15\n\nYou might ask if the first iteration starting with 0 is necessary. And you're correct – it's redundant and is a case for not providing an initial value at all!\n// sum all numbers in the array\n// start with `1`\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].reduce((previousValue, currentValue) => {\n  console.log(previousValue);\n  // the return value will be the next `previousValue`\n  return previousValue + currentValue;\n}); // 15\n\n// Output in the console:\n// 1 \n// 3\n// 6\n// 10 \n// 15\n\nWithout a second argument, the reduce loop starts with the first array entry instead of an initial value – ergo, you'll save one iteration! 🎉\nThis is a nifty little find! Big thanks to Ramón, who tweeted this tip!\nIf you want to learn more about the array method, head over to the reduce entry on MDN.\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",
