          "description": "If you're a tab hoarder like me, you probably noticed that browsers discard inactive browser tabs to save resources eventually. The tabs are still open and visible in the browser UI but are put to sleep and only brought back and reloaded on tab focus.\nToday I found out that there are ways to control if tabs should be discarded and even discard tabs yourself.\nIn Chrome/Edge navigate to about://discards (about is a shorthand to use the same protocol in Chrome and Edge and find all open tabs ready to be controlled.\n\n\n\n\n          \n            \nAll tab entries include an Urgent Discard button to put them to sleep, and you can configure if a particular tab should be auto-discardable, too.\nSimilar functionality will be included in Firefox 94 at about:unloads. The page provides insights into the allocated tab resources and allows you to \"unload\" them one at a time. What's different here is that you can't decide which tabs to unload because the \"unload\" button only discards tabs in a prioritized order. 🤷‍♂️\n\n\n\n          \n            \nAll in all, tab discarding is a handy functionality, and I'll try out discarding all tabs the next time I'm running low on memory or battery. (I can't lose all the tabs...)\nBut configuring \"auto discard\" for each tab, I won't mess with it. Browsers don't discard active tabs like a YouTube music video or the Slack UI, and they're probably smarter at figuring out when an active tab consumes too many resources than I am. 😉\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",

          "description": "When writing Node.js automation/build scripts, I occasionally need \"sleep\" functionality to wait for other tasks to finish. It's not great to implement \"sleeps and waits\", but sometimes there's no other way than waiting for another system to finish what it's doing.\nI often use the following snippet in a Node.js module script. 👇\nFYI: Node.js modules support top-level await.\n// File: index.mjs\n\nconst sleep = (time) => {\n  return new Promise((resolve) => {\n    setTimeout(resolve, time);\n  });\n}\n\n// do something\nawait sleep(5000);\n// do something else\n\nThere's nothing particularly wrong with this approach, but I'm very pleased to see that promises-based timer functions are available in Node.js 16 via timers/promises now.\n// File: index.mjs\n\nimport {\n  setTimeout,\n} from 'timers/promises';\n\n// do something\nawait setTimeout(5000);\n// do something else\n\nLess code is always better code! 👏\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",

          "description": "There's been some buzz about Safari (and its \"quirks\") lately. In its latest round, the webdev community discovered that Webkit (the engine powering Safari) supports the new and fancy AVIF image format, but Safari does not. Outrageous – how can that be?\nIf you want to learn more about AVIF, Jake Archibald has you covered. 😉\nI haven't played much with the new image format yet, but it's supposed to lead to smaller files than webp and jpeg. That's great news – a faster web is a better web. You can use the picture element, let the browser load the best and newest image format, and call it a day. Win-win!\nBut Apple decided not to ship AVIF in Safari because the image format is not supported in their operating systems yet.\nWhy would one disable features that make websites faster?\n\nApple product…",
