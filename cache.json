          "description": "I just read the article \"URLs: It's complicated...\" and learned a few nifty tricks about internal pages in Chromies (Edge, Chrome, etc.) and Firefox.\nYou might know about the hidden browser games in Chrome (chrome://dino/) and Edge (edge://surf/), or the commonly used browser flags pages (chrome://flags, edge://flags and so on).\n\n\n\n\n          \n            \nLet's have a look at three things that make internal page handling easier!\nUse about instead of your specific browser scheme\n\nAs described on web.dev, Chromium browsers rewrite not-matching browser schemes, if you enter an incorrect one. You can access chrome://flags in Edge and it'll be rewritten to edge://flags. That's already pretty handy, but there's more!\nYou can also use the about scheme to \"resolve\" to the correct browser scheme. about://flags becomes chrome://flags, brave://flags, or edge://flags depending on your browser. This rewrite is a great addition and I made it a habit to use about for all internal pages already!\nYou can leave out the //\n\nWhile playing around with the about pages, I noticed that you can make the URL even shorter. Enter about:flags and it's correctly resolved to chrome://flags. That's pretty nice, too!\nabout:about ‚Äì a list of all internal pages\n\nAnd here's the kicker, if you wonder what internal pages your Chromium browser or Firefox provides, you can enter about:about...\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n            \nAnd there you have it, about:about lists all internal pages! I'll continue poking around all these pages now. üëã\nPssst... If you like these short learnings, I send out a weekly newsletter.\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",

          "description": "If you're using EcmaScript modules, you probably know the problem that you can't \"just\" import JSON files. To import and load a JSON file in an ES module, you have to do a \"window.fetch dance\" to request the file and parse it yourself. It's not great...\nBut there's hope! According to chromestatus.com, JSON Modules are shipping in Chrome 91. I gave it a quick try, and surprisingly, the following JavaScript code does not work.\n<script type=\"module\">\n  import data from \"./data.json\";\n  console.log(data);\n</script>\n\nIt throws the following exception in Chrome 91:\nFailed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript module script but the server responded with a MIME type of \"application/json\". Strict MIME type checking is enforced for module scripts per HTML spec.\nI didn't have a detailed look at the spec discussion about this topic, but apparently, the new syntax to import JSON Modules is the following. üò≤\nimport data from \"./data.json\" assert { type: \"json\" };\n\nconsole.log(data);\n\nThat's quite something, and I have to do some reading about it. But hey, anything that makes it easier to import JSON is more than welcome!\nAnd when there's a solution in Chrome, it can't be long until it ships in Node.js because importing JSON files in Node ES modules is not great either. üôà\nEdit: Axel Rauschmayer shared that JSON import are based on import assertions and you can read more about it on his blog.\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",
