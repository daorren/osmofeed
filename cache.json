And he hit the nail on the head with \"Browsers, JSON, and FormData\".\nSo what's the current state of the web?\nIt's bloated with truckloads of JavaScript, and APIs power everything. APIs won't go anywhere, but we're all working on reducing JavaScript.\nTo drop some code while still relying on APIs, there are two options:\nWe need either 1) more APIs that speak FormData, or 2) browsers that speak JSON.\nOn point, Jim! On point. 💯\nThink of it: isn't it wild that JSON APIs only work with JavaScript and Ajax because JSON requests aren't supported in HTML?\nTo put it bluntly: there’s no progressive enhancement if all your APIs only accept JSON payloads directly from the browser.\nWith the rise of all these APIs, we either have to rely on client-side JavaScript to talk to APIs directly or pipe everything through a serverless function. And we're so used to doing this that we don't even question it anymore.\nThe web platform is entirely broken in that sense if you ask me. And it's funny, because Jim dug up a spec that aimed to bring JSON into HTML. 😲\n<form enctype='application/json'>\n  <input name='name' value='Bender'>\n  <select name='hind'>\n    <option selected>Bitable</option>\n    <option>Kickable</option>\n  </select>\n  <input type='checkbox' name='shiny' checked>\n</form>\n\nUnfortunately, the spec went nowhere...\nBut think of it: with JSON built into HTML forms, and View transitions coming up (formerly known as Shared Element Transistions), the web could really catch up and become the platform it needs to be these days.\nAnyways, head over to Jim's blog; it's a good one, I promise!\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",

          "description": "I've been reading one of Temani Afif's CSS magic posts and discovered a clip-path CSS trick I wasn't aware of.\nclip-path allows you to clip an element in various ways. You can use geometric shapes like circles and SVG paths. It's pretty cool!\n.element {\n  clip-path: circle(50px at 0 100px);\n  clip-path: path(\n    \"M0.5,1 C0.5,1,0,0.7,0,0.3 A0.25,0.25,1,1,1,1,0.3 C1,0.7,0.5,1,0.5,1 Z\"\n  );\n}\n\nBut to be fair, I haven't used clip-path extensively, because a) my projects aren't that fancy, and b) I can't be bothered with creating complicated SVG paths.\nBut then there's also polygon. With polygon you can define clipping pointed with relative percentages. Handy!\n.element {\n  clip-path: polygon(50% 0%, 100% 50%, 50% 100%, 0% 50%);\n}\n\nAnd Temani shared that you can even define points outside the 100% range, too! 😲\nIt’s a little known fact that clip-path accepts values outside the 0%-100% range, which allows us to create “overflowing” shapes.\nThis detail is something I could get my head around to create some custom corners!\n[Interactive component: visit the article to see it...]\nThank you, Temani!\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",

          "description": "Wes Bos has advocated using the trash-cli instead of the rm command this week.\nThe reasoning: rm is unrecoverable. Once you remove files or directories using rm, they're gone. Ergo, you can bring yourself into real trouble using rm.\nI assume one could do some wild forensic stuff to restore bits and bytes on your hard drive, but the deleted files have to be very important to go this route.\ntrash can help out here! The command doesn't delete files but moves them to your operating system's trash directory. When you then accidentally delete something important, head over to your lovely bin icon and recover files from there!\nBut here's the kicker: installing the global trash-cli package comes with 829 dependency files. Markdown, JavaScript, JSON and license files are all at your service, making up a whopping 4.3MB heavy node_modules directory.\nSure, 4 MB isn't an issue for me on my developer machine. And the command runs fast enough to protect me and my fat fingers from self-destruction. But still, that's a lot of dependency code to move files into another directory, isn't it?\nA native trash CLI function\n\nLiran Tal thought the same and shared a nifty four-liner giving you all of trash's functionality.\ntrash() {\n  echo \"[x] moving files to trash...\"\n  mv \"$@\" \"$HOME/.trash\"\n}\n\nI played around with Liran's function and adjusted it also to support multiple files.\n# ✅ globs          – `trash file-*-.txt`\n# ✅ directories    – `trash directory`\n# ✅ multiple files - `trash file-1 dir-1 file-2`\nfunction trash() {\n  echo \"🗑️  Moving files to trash...\"\n\n  for var in \"$@\"\n  do\n    mv \"$var\" \"$HOME/.trash\"\n  done\n}\n\nSo far, my new trash command has been working great. I'll let you know when I'll discover any issues!\nDisclaimer: I only tested this shell function in my environment: macOS and ZSH.\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",
