Unfortunately, this assumption is wrong in many cases.\nIf you want to learn about more inaccessible HTML features, a recent HTMHell article covered many of them. It's a great read!\nThis week, I've learned that even simple things, such as linking to local elements via id (<a href=\"#something\">), require careful consideration not to cause accessibility problems.\nWhat's the issue with local links?\ndocument.activeElement is only set to focusable elements\n\nI've been reading How To Avoid Breaking Web Pages For Keyboard Users and learned that some assistive technologies rely on document.activeElement.\nThe activeElement read-only property of the Document interface retâ€¦",

And now that we're close to wrapping up 2023, what new features should you start learning?\nThis week's Web Weekly includes all the answers and much more. Enjoy!\nLet's kick off this Web Weekly with some short'n'sweet HTML form trivia!\nI was reading the excellent HTMHell advents calendar and discovered a nifty fun fact.\nDid you know that a button can submit a form even though it's not included in one?\nPut a button somewhere on the page, and reference the form to submit by id â€” done! The form attribute can be invaluable when your design requires submitting a form on the other side of the page. ðŸ˜…\nBut today's trivia doesn't stop here!\nâ€¦",
