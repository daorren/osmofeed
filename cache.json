          "description": "I have the constant urge to \"do stuff\". My to-do and idea lists are endless collections of things I'd love to do one day. But there's a problem — my side hustle schedule is pretty busy already.\nI want to keep this blog active. I run a weekly web development newsletter. I maintain some open-source projects. I collect online tools.\nThese projects alone eat a good chunk of my free time, and while I love doing them, they add up. There are only so many hours in the day.\nFor years, I ran the @randomMDN Twitter bot. Then Elmo broke the Twitter APIs. I was puzzled. \"This is one of my projects; it can't just be over, can it?\" buzzed in my head. I've had a hard time letting go, I guess.\nFast forward. I hadn't had time to fix or deal with the problem, and it was over. Just like that, one of my projects dropped off the list.\nLovely people ported Random MDN to the Fediverse if you want random web dev facts in your feed.\nI realized I treat most projects as \"forever projects\".\nOf course, I work on this project every week. Of course, I'll answer these GitHub issues over the weekend. Of course, I keep this online resource up-to-date. And, of course, this isn't a sustainable.\nAs Jamie Wilkinson puts it, he doesn't want to do forever projects anymore. Everything has a shelf life. Kicking things off is great, but letting things go is as important.\nTreat beginnings like endings: celebrate them, document them.\nIt's simple: to have time for new projects and passions, one has to let go.\nBy ending well, you give yourself the freedom to begin again.\nGreat advice.\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",

          "description": "htmx has been pretty loud lately because it moves functionality, like swapping out DOM elements into declarative HTML. Love it or hate it, I think it's a \"fresh\" approach to the overcomplicated world of JS frameworks.\n<script src=\"https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@1.9.10\"></script>\n<!-- have a button POST a click via AJAX -->\n<button hx-post=\"/clicked\" hx-swap=\"outerHTML\">\n  Click Me\n</button>\n\nAdd the 14kb compressed file to your sites and create dynamic interactions. Everything's just a hx-whatever attribute away. Sweet!\nCould you do similar things with less JavaScript? And while I wouldn't recommend using htmz in production, it does some HTML-swapping magic with 176 JS bytes. How? With very creative iframe usage.\n<iframe hidden name=htmz onload=\"setTimeout(()=>document.querySelector(this.contentWindow.location.hash||null)?.replaceWith(...this.contentDocument.body.childNodes))\"></iframe>\n\n<!-- Loads /flower.html onto #my-element -->\n<a href=\"/flower.html#my-element\" target=htmz>Flower</a>\n\nIs the project a joke? Sorta — maybe not. But whether we talk about htmx or htmz or whatever comes next, it becomes clear that we're lacking some HTML primitives. But maybe frames were already good enough? #oldIsNew 😅\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",
