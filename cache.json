That's great news – a faster web is a better web. You can use the picture element, let the browser load the best and newest image format, and call it a day.

And all that led to a very slow Sunday. 🙈\nOther than that, I'm participating in leadership coaching right now, and last week I learned about a new approach to decision-making. My coach and I discussed three ways/lenses to look at conflicts, decisions and the world.\nThe reverse lens: “What would the other person in this conflict say?\"\nThe long lens: \"How will I look at this problem in six months?\"\nThe wide lens: \"How can I learn and grow from the situation?\"\nI really like this approach of considering \"the bigger picture\" and will try to use it going forward. Let's make less hot-headed and short-sighted decisions!\nBefore we jump into web st…",

          "description": "Today I discovered an exciting section in the CSS media queries Level 5 spec. The custom media queries section explains how to define and reuse aliases for media queries. Why would you need that?\nWell... if you're using CSS custom properties and wanted to use them in a media query, you probably discovered that you can't use custom properties in this context. CSS custom properties weren't designed for that use case. Bummer!\n:root {\n  --width: 20em;\n}\n\n/* that doesn't work :/ */\n@media (min-width: var(--width)) {\n}\n\n\nYou could now rely on tools such as Sass and introduce another non-native variable system to clean up your media queries, but yeah... this approach is not great!\nBut here's the solution – say hello to custom media queries!\n@custom-media --narrow-window (max-width: 30em);\n\n@media (--narrow-window) {\n  /* narrow window styles */\n}\n\nIsn't this beautiful? I think many web developers are waiting for that for quite some time. But here's the sad news: you can't use custom media queries today because it's only future music.\nI googled around for a few minutes, and apparently, custom media queries are in the spec for years. There doesn't seem to be much interest in implementing it, though. Neither MDN nor caniuse.com knows about the feature. :/\nIf you want to use it today, leverage PostCSS and the Custom Media plugin. That's better than nothing, but hey... can we have custom media queries, please?\nEdits and comments\n\n\nAdam Argyle filed a Chromium feature request for it now. 🎉 You can give your vote here.\nMarco Biedermann pointed out that custom media queries are part of the postcss-present-env stage 1.\n\n\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",
