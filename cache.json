Why's that?\nFor me, it boils down to two reasons.\nNew devices and monitors can display colors that aren't defined in the sRGB color space used by rgb(), hsl() or hex colors. Isn't it sad that you can't express these vibrant colors in CSS using existing color methods?\nIt is. And the solution are new CSS color functions that can talk new and fancy monitor tech (namely wide-gamut P3 colors). It's party time y'all — the web gets a color update with fresh and vibrant colors.\nThere's oklch(), oklab() and also color() to target the wider color space, but let's focus on oklch() because it's the most user-friendly.\noklch()'s parameters (lightness, chroma and hue) are easy to grasp and feel very similar …",
