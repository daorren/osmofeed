          "description": "I've been reading one of Temani Afif's CSS magic posts and discovered a clip-path CSS trick I wasn't aware of.\nclip-path allows you to clip an element in various ways. You can use geometric shapes like circles and SVG paths. It's pretty cool!\n.element {\n  clip-path: circle(50px at 0 100px);\n  clip-path: path(\n    \"M0.5,1 C0.5,1,0,0.7,0,0.3 A0.25,0.25,1,1,1,1,0.3 C1,0.7,0.5,1,0.5,1 Z\"\n  );\n}\n\nBut to be fair, I haven't used clip-path extensively, because a) my projects aren't that fancy, and b) I can't be bothered with creating complicated SVG paths.\nBut then there's also polygon. With polygon you can define clipping pointed with relative percentages. Handy!\n.element {\n  clip-path: polygon(50% 0%, 100% 50%, 50% 100%, 0% 50%);\n}\n\nAnd Temani shared that you can even define points outside the 100% range, too! 😲\nIt’s a little known fact that clip-path accepts values outside the 0%-100% range, which allows us to create “overflowing” shapes.\nThis detail is something I could get my head around to create some custom corners!\n[Interactive component: visit the article to see it...]\nThank you, Temani!\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",

          "description": "Wes Bos has advocated using the trash-cli instead of the rm command this week.\nThe reasoning: rm is unrecoverable. Once you remove files or directories using rm, they're gone. Ergo, you can bring yourself into real trouble using rm.\nI assume one could do some wild forensic stuff to restore bits and bytes on your hard drive, but the deleted files have to be very important to go this route.\ntrash can help out here! The command doesn't delete files but moves them to your operating system's trash directory. When you then accidentally delete something important, head over to your lovely bin icon and recover files from there!\nBut here's the kicker: installing the global trash-cli package comes with 829 dependency files. Markdown, JavaScript, JSON and license files are all at your service, making up a whopping 4.3MB heavy node_modules directory.\nSure, 4 MB isn't an issue for me on my developer machine. And the command runs fast enough to protect me and my fat fingers from self-destruction. But still, that's a lot of dependency code to move files into another directory, isn't it?\nA native trash CLI function\n\nLiran Tal thought the same and shared a nifty four-liner giving you all of trash's functionality.\ntrash() {\n  echo \"[x] moving files to trash...\"\n  mv \"$@\" \"$HOME/.trash\"\n}\n\nI played around with Liran's function and adjusted it also to support multiple files.\n# ✅ globs          – `trash file-*-.txt`\n# ✅ directories    – `trash directory`\n# ✅ multiple files - `trash file-1 dir-1 file-2`\nfunction trash() {\n  echo \"🗑️  Moving files to trash...\"\n\n  for var in \"$@\"\n  do\n    mv \"$var\" \"$HOME/.trash\"\n  done\n}\n\nSo far, my new trash command has been working great. I'll let you know when I'll discover any issues!\nDisclaimer: I only tested this shell function in my environment: macOS and ZSH.\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",

          "description": "Some people love custom elements, and it seems that even more people are entirely against them. And while I'm leaning towards using them, today I learned a fascinating custom elements take.\nI've been reading one of Adam Argyle's excellent component walk-throughs, and Adam shared a tool-tip custom element that works without the usual customElements.define JavaScript instruction.\nTo quote Adam:\nYou could think of a custom element like a classname with less specificity.\nThat's an interesting take because it changes the mental model around custom elements! Custom elements are usually used to encapsulate functionality as web components with JavaScript, but one could also use them as another style hook with lower specificity than class selectors. Neat!\nUse Polypane's specificity calculator if you want to learn more about CSS specificity.\nAnd to make the custom element accessible, Adam's example tool-tip component receives its semantic meaning via ARIA...\n<tool-tip role=\"tooltip\">A tooltip</tool-tip>\n\n... and the show/hide functionality is then added via CSS has(). 😲\n/* Only show the custom element when its parent is hovered, focused, or activated */\n:has(> tool-tip):is(:hover, :focus-visible, :active) > tool-tip {\n opacity: 1;\n transition-delay: 200ms;\n}\n\nVery smart!\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",

          "description": "Not too long ago, I was looking into refactoring my site to go all in with CSS grid!\nI've been aiming for a classical centered blog layout with flexible side margins. The content should be 65 characters wide at max. But (!) I wanted to be able to break free, and some components should go full-width by setting a class. And it should all work with CSS grid.\nAfter fiddling with it for a while, I didn't reach a satisfying result and decided to do it another day. In the meantime, Ryan Mulligan's post \"Layout Breakouts with CSS Grid\" provided the CSS solution I was looking for (see it in action on CodePen).\nThe solution: named grid-template-columns and some math\n\nPut all your content in a content wrapper element that defines named grid areas:\n.content {\n  --gap: clamp(1rem, 6vw, 3rem);\n  --full: minmax(var(--gap), 1fr);\n  --content: min(50ch, 100% - var(--gap) * 2);\n  --popout: minmax(0, 2rem);\n  --feature: minmax(0, 5rem);\n\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns:\n    [full-start] var(--full)\n    [feature-start] var(--feature)\n    [popout-start] var(--popout)\n    [content-start] var(--content) [content-end]\n    var(--popout) [popout-end]\n    var(--feature) [feature-end]\n    var(--full) [full-end];\n}\n\nAnd then control all the component widths using grid template areas. 💯\n.content > * {\n  grid-column: content;\n}\n.popout {\n  grid-column: popout;\n}\n.feature {\n  grid-column: feature;\n}\n.full {\n  grid-column: full;\n}\n\nThe post even includes a beautiful visualization that explains what's going on. 👏\nI love it. 💙 Thank you, Ryan!\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",
