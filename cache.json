          "description": "Chris Coyier shared a fascinating post describing a bug that only appeared on low-resolution devices. The post brings up the interesting problem of low-resolution devices. I usually work on a MacBook Pro and a decent monitor so that I rarely see and check the things I build in lower resolutions.\nDeveloper tools offer ways to emulate lower DPR (device pixel ratio), and tools such as dpilove indeed show different resolution values after adjusting the DPR. However, the website still looks sharp and crisp on my MacBook. I wonder if I'm missing something here?\n\n\n\n\n          \n            \nAfter reading Chris' post, I learned that you can enable low-resolution mode when developing on a high-resolution Mac. Open the app information for your browser, tick the box for \"Open in Low Resolution\" and start the application.\n\n\n\n\n          \n            \nWhen you then open the app (my example shows Chrome Canary), you see a clear visual difference. The website is rendered in low resolution, everything is a bit \"blurry\", and even the browser frame and controls are not rendered in sharp retina style anymore.\nThat's good to know for future debugging sessions that deal with device pixel ratio!\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",

          "description": "Accessible form inputs are essential for building an inclusive web. It's no news that input elements should come with a properly describing label. There are two HTML-native approaches to connect a label element with an input element.\n<!-- reference the id of the input element -->\n<label for=\"email\">\n  Your email address\n</label>\n<input type=\"email\" name=\"email\" id=\"email\">\n\n\n<!-- wrap the input element with a label -->\n<label>\n  Your email address\n  <input type=\"email\" name=\"email\">\n</label>\n\nI love the input-wrapping approach because I don't have to invent ids to connect a label with an input. Additionally, it increases the tab/click area of the wrapped input element, making it more accessible with an improved UX!\nIt would be such a beautiful solution if there wouldn't be the usual Frontend problem of supporting countless browsers, devices and assistive technologies such as screen readers.\nApparently, the Dragon speech recognition software is not supporting wrapping labels (Dragon product page), which means you still have to use for/id when wrapping your inputs.\n<!-- wrapped input + for/id connection -->\n<label for=\"email\">\n  Your email address\n  <input type=\"email\" name=\"email\" id=\"email\">\n</label>\n\nAnd that's it. This quick post's purpose is purely to have the links above at hand in the future, so that's it already. 🙈\nIf you want to read more about labels and input, have a look at Adrian Roselli's post My Priority of Methods for Labeling a Control.\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",

Website visitors have to be able to navigate content and focusable element sequentially.\nSuccess Criterion 2.4.3 Focus Order (Level A): If a Web page can be navigated sequentially and the navigation sequences affect meaning or operation, focusable components receive focus in an order that preserves meaning and operability.\nHow can you test for this accessibility success criterion most effectively?\nThe first option, tab around your web pages manually and see where the focus wanders. While there's nothing wrong with this, browser dev tools (mainly Firefox) offer valuable alternatives to manual testing these days.\nLet's have a look!\nFirefox – \"show tabbing order\" of all focusable elements\n\n\n\n\n      …",

          "description": "I just came across this tweet from Josh Comeau. Josh shared that Safari is not \"zooming into\" focused form elements if they have a font size of or larger than 16px. I don't have an iPhone, but I can imagine that the zoom interaction is pretty distracting when you \"just\" want to fill out a form.\nWhy is Safari zooming in for controls that have a font size less than 16px? 16px is the default body font size for most browsers and is what you get after declaring font-size: 100%; on :root. 16px is the smalled accessible font size according to accessibility resources.\nJosh's discovery is a fact that'll come in handy in the future because I had a few discussions about font sizes lately. Some folks tend to prefer small and light grey fonts – the less readable, the better. 🙈\nI doubt that the iOS zoom argument will be the game-changer in these discussions, but the more arguments for accessible web design I have the more likely I can convince someone! 🎉\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",

          "description": "I just read the article \"URLs: It's complicated...\" and learned a few nifty tricks about internal pages in Chromies (Edge, Chrome, etc.) and Firefox.\nYou might know about the hidden browser games in Chrome (chrome://dino/) and Edge (edge://surf/), or the commonly used browser flags pages (chrome://flags, edge://flags and so on).\n\n\n\n\n          \n            \nLet's have a look at three things that make internal page handling easier!\nUse about instead of your specific browser scheme\n\nAs described on web.dev, Chromium browsers rewrite not-matching browser schemes, if you enter an incorrect one. You can access chrome://flags in Edge and it'll be rewritten to edge://flags. That's already pretty handy, but there's more!\nYou can also use the about scheme to \"resolve\" to the correct browser scheme. about://flags becomes chrome://flags, brave://flags, or edge://flags depending on your browser. This rewrite is a great addition and I made it a habit to use about for all internal pages already!\nYou can leave out the //\n\nWhile playing around with the about pages, I noticed that you can make the URL even shorter. Enter about:flags and it's correctly resolved to chrome://flags. That's pretty nice, too!\nabout:about – a list of all internal pages\n\nAnd here's the kicker, if you wonder what internal pages your Chromium browser or Firefox provides, you can enter about:about...\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n            \nAnd there you have it, about:about lists all internal pages! I'll continue poking around all these pages now. 👋\nPssst... If you like these short learnings, I send out a weekly newsletter.\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",
