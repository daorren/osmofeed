Enjoy!\nLet's kick off this Web Weekly with some short'n'sweet HTML form trivia!\nI was reading the excellent HTMHell advents calendar and discovered a nifty fun fact.\nDid you know that a button can submit a form even though it's not included in one?\nPut a button somewhere on the page, and reference the form to submit by id — done! The form attribute can be invaluable when your design requires submitting a form on the other side of the page. 😅\nBut today's trivia doesn't stop here!\n…",

Why's that?\nFor me, it boils down to two reasons.\nNew devices and monitors can display colors that aren't defined in the sRGB color space used by rgb(), hsl() or hex colors. Isn't it sad that you can't express these vibrant colors in CSS using existing color methods?\nIt is. And the solution are new CSS color functions that can talk new and fancy monitor tech (namely wide-gamut P3 colors). It's party time y'all — the web gets a color update with fresh and vibrant colors.\nThere's oklch(), oklab() and also color() to target the wider color space, but let's focus on oklch() because it's the most user-friendly.\noklch()'s parameters (lightness, chroma and hue) are easy to grasp and feel very similar …",
