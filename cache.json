But as far as I can tell, even though it's uncommon it's still a perfectly valid HTML attribute. So, how would you query this element?\nYou surely could use the good old document.getElementById()...\nconsole.log(document.getElementById('#')); // <div id=\"#\">...\n\nThis works, but I rarely use getElementById because it limits me to select elements via an id. Duh! ðŸ˜…\ndocument.querySelector, on the other hand, is more flexible and allows any DOM element to be queried with a CSS selector.\nBut can you select this \"hash id element\" with a CSS selector using querySelector? Turns out you can't.\nconsole.log(document.querySelector('##'));\n// SyntaxError: â€¦",
