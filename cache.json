It's the longest break since I started Web Weekly, and I can't say that this doesn't bug me, but I needed the break. Life was super busy; I moved, traveled countries to speak at a conference, and then got sick for a few days. It's been a ride...\nBut it's all good, and I'm back! Thank you to all the people who checked in with me. ðŸ’™\nLet's get back to business!\nShould HTML allow us to ship responsive videos? How can you optimize your fetch calls? And is there an easy way to escape CSS classes in JavaScript?\nThis week's Web Weekly includes all the answers and much more. Enjoy!\nPeople were raving about barrel files this week. What's a barrel file? Here's one.\nThe idea behind barrel filesâ€¦",

But as far as I can tell, even though it's uncommon it's still a perfectly valid HTML attribute. So, how would you query this element?\nYou surely could use the good old document.getElementById()...\nconsole.log(document.getElementById('#')); // <div id=\"#\">...\n\nThis works, but I rarely use getElementById because it limits me to select elements via an id. Duh! ðŸ˜…\ndocument.querySelector, on the other hand, is more flexible and allows any DOM element to be queried with a CSS selector.\nBut can you select this \"hash id element\" with a CSS selector using querySelector?
