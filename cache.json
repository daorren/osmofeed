Wouldn't it be nice if you could create shadows that pick up a DOM elements color?\nGuess what?

What if there's one annoying 3rd party script messing with your events and you have to keep it?\nToday I learned about a nuclear option to remove all existing event listeners.\nconst button = document.querySelector('button);\n\n// replace the element with a copy of itself\n// and nuke all the event listeners\nbutton.replaceWith(button.cloneNode(true));\n\nBoom! And that's it — replacing a DOM element with a cloned version of itself removes all previously registered event handlers. Pretty handy!\nIf you want to see this pattern in action, here we go. 👇\n[Interactive component: visit the article to see it...]\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",

In their words, Twoslash is:\nmarkdown code samples powered by the syntax engine of Visual Studio Code\nmixed with the TypeScript compiler’s information.\nAnd that's pretty incredible, because it's also able to validate your code and show possible Typescript errors.\nts\n\ninterface Person {\n  name: string\n}\n \ninterface Person {\n  age: number\n}\n \n// `Person` is now merged and expects `name` and `age`\nconst p: Person = {\nProperty 'name' is missing in type '{ age: number; }' but required in type 'Person'.2741Property 'name' is missing in type '{ age: number; }' but required in type 'Person'.\n  age: 99\n}\n\n\nYou can let Twoslash do its job; if your snippets aren't correct, it'll complain and error out (unless you tell it that you expect an error like above).\nAnd because it uses the VS Code type checker, it works for JavaScript snippets, too!\njs\n\nconst a = {\n  joo: 'test'\n};\n \nconsole.log(a.foo);\nProperty 'foo' does not exist on type '{ joo: string; }'.2339Property 'foo' does not exist on type '{ joo: string; }'.\n\nAnd then, you can use some fancy markdown syntax to inspect variables and even show possible auto-completion values.\njs\n\nconst a = {\n  test: 'test'\n  testTwo: 'test'\n  testThree: 'test'\n};\n \nconsole.log(a.te\n                \ntest\ntestThree\ntestTwo\n\n \n \nconsole.log(a);\n           \nconst a: {\n    test: string;\n    testTwo: string;\n    testThree: string;\n}\n\n\nWild! 🤯\nI'm not entirely convinced I'll use Twoslash for every code snippet on the blog, but for TypeScript snippets — heck yeah!\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",
