          "description": "The great thing about Git is that almost all actions are reversible! But there's one command that isn't, and it can cause real headaches — git clean.\n# remove all untracked files\ngit clean .\n\nThe clean command removes untracked files from your Git working tree, and while that's sometimes exactly what you want, you should really run the command with caution.\nYou're probably frustrated when you want to start over, but you should be sure you want to throw away everything. Some files might still be valuable. If you run git clean, they're gone — end of story.\nBy default, Git will not allow you to clean up a repository unless you have clean.requireForce set to false. But you know how it is: an innocent -f is quickly added.\nI learned today that git clean (and other commands) support a --dry-run option.\ngit clean --dry-run .\nWould remove not-important.js\nWould remove untracked-but-very-important.js\n\nIf you want a shorter command line option, use the very intuitive (not!) -n argument.\ngit clean -n .\nWould remove not-important.js\nWould remove untracked-but-very-important.js\n\nThe command prints out what it would remove without doing any damage. Handy! It also comes with a useful interactive mode to handle many untracked files.\ngit clean -i\nWould remove the following items:\n  not-important.js   untracked-but-very-important.js\n  \n*** Commands ***\n  1: clean   2: filter by pattern   3: select by numbers   4: ask each   5: quit   6: help\nWhat now> 4\nRemove not-important.js [y/N]? y\nRemove untracked-but-very-important.js [y/N]? N\nRemoving not-important.js\n\nYou can choose between pattern matching or checking each file one by one in the interactive mode. Nice one, Git! 💪\nBut what about other Git commands? Most of the other dry runs don't seem very exciting to me because, as said, most of the Git operations are reversible. But one that I could see come in handy is a git remote prune dry run to avoid removing remote branches. But that's about it. 🤷‍♂️\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",

          "description": "My dotfiles are powering multiple machines, and overall I've been happy with them. They include hand-written shell scripts to create symlinks, download all desktop apps and CLI tools, and get my preferred system settings in place. But overall, they've become a Frankenstein over time because many random scripts are doing random things. And obviously, I failed to document what's going on properly.\nSure, scripts have to run to install stuff, but for config file management, most solutions I've seen seemed too complicated to keep some files in sync. And I really don't want to use a dotfile framework to pull some configuration files.\nWhat if there is a way to tweak Git and track all the .*rc and config files?\n\"Dotfiles management\" describes Git magic to track all files somewhere on your machine from a single .git repository. Yes, your read that right. Any file and anywhere.\nalias dotfiles='git --git-dir=/home/mx/.dotfiles --work-tree=/'\n\nThat's right; there's a .git folder somewhere on your machine (/home/mx/.dotfiles in the example), and it'll track all the files no matter where they're located, thanks to the --work-tree argument. Then there's no symlink dance!\nWith some additional configuration, you can add and sync files across machines without scripts using dotfiles add or dotfiles commit. It's all just plain Git.\nThis dotfiles approach is by far the smartest I've seen, and I'll definitely give it a shot when I fiddle with my system config the next time.\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",

          "description": "I'm continuing my journey of learning TypeScript, and it's a wild ride. Sometimes I feel like I have things under control, but other times, I'm looking at a type definition at work, and all I can do is scratch my head in confusion. It'll be a long journey!\nToday I discovered a somewhat basic but very useful feature that's in TS since 3.4 (released in 2019). That's a century in web development, but hey, I'm still starting out!\nHow to narrow types with const assertions\n\nLet's look at a trivial example.\nconst resource = {id: '123'};\n\nif (resource.id === '234') {\n  console.log('yay!');\n}\n\nIf you look at it, you'll probably see that there's no way this code logs out yay! because the resource.id isn't changed to 234. But TypeScript doesn't know that, and if you inspect the resulting type, you'll find that resource.id is just a string. And that does make sense because it doesn't matter if you declare an object with the const keyword; you can still change the properties as you like.\nBut what if you want to treat the object as truly immutable? Turns out, you can narrow types and explicitly tell TypeScript that resource won't change with two words — as const.\nconst resource = {id: '123'} as const;\n\nif (resource.id === '234') {\n  console.log('yay');\n}\n\nAnd voilà — look at this extra level of type safety! 👏\nNow that TypeScript knows that resource is immutable, it narrows the property type from string to 123, and it complains if you're trying to alter the constant object. That's pretty handy for all sorts of operations!\nThe TypeScript docs are a quick read if you want to learn more.\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",
