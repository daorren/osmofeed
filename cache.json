Let me introduce you to the value attribute. 👇\n\n        \n\n        \nStefan Judis\n              @stefanjudis\n            \nQuick HTML tip: I just discovered that `li` elements support a `value` attribute to configure the start of an ordered list. \n369 retweets\n            2715 likes\n\n            Tweeted \n              \n                Apr 04 2022\n              \n            \n            Open Tweet\n          \n\nTrending Tweets often come with priceless comments. And it turned out that there are multiple ways to control the numbers of an ordered list.\nLet's have a quick look!\nSpecify the list start using start\n\nManuel pointed out that the start attribute also allows you to specify the beginning of the unordered list. Ordered lists usually start at 1.\n[Interactive component: visit the article to see it...]\nThis functionality is valuable if your listings are divided by paragraphs and additional information.\nDefine the list item position using value\n\nAs already mentioned; if you want to control the position of a single list item, you can also use the value attribute on a specific list item.\n[Interactive component: visit the article to see it...]\nThis functionality is valuable if you're dealing with rankings and two entries are in the same position.\nBonus: Control list styles via CSS\n\nAnd for completeness, there are also ways to control the list styles via list-style in CSS.\n[Interactive component: visit the article to see it...]\nRead more about list-style on MDN.\nIf you're going for custom list styles, don't visually change the meaning of your listing to keep your HTML accessible in RSS feeds or assistive technology.\n\nIt's so fascinating that HTML still holds surprises for me after writing it for over ten years!\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",

But everything's on track again! 😊\nI started building a proper landing page for this newsletter mainly to play around with Remix. It felt great that I didn't hit any blockers and could get rolling right away. The structure of Remix files reminds me of writing PHP back in the day, though. Is this web development repeating itself with another file extension?\nI have a quick ask: do you see the testimonials section? I'd love to include more quotes in it.
