I don't own a printer, let alone a scanner, so occasionally, I drag myself to the local copy shop to do official business.\nUntil now! I've been browsing Hacker News, and the shell script below takes a PDF and makes it look like it's been scanned.\n#!/bin/sh\nROTATION=$(shuf -n 1 -e '-' '')$(shuf -n 1 -e $(seq 0.05 .5))\n\nconvert -density 150 $1 \\\n  -linear-stretch '1.5%x2%' \\\n  -rotate ${ROTATION} \\\n  -attenuate '0.01' \\\n  +noise  Multiplicative \\\n  -colorspace 'gray' $2\n  \n\nSuppose you called the scrip index.sh you can now run the following command...\n./index.sh original.pdf scanned.pdf\n\n... to scan your PDFs without a physical scanner.\nSide note: the convert command is part of the imagemagick tools and wasn't available on my machine.

I removed ten extensions and am now with 25 that I use actively, more or less.\nThe best extensions blend in so well that you'll be surprised that VS Code doesn't offer certain functionality natively. It's the ones \"fixing\" the editor that stand out!\nAnd I have a hunch that \"Better Folding\" created by Mohammad Baqer will be one of them. Let me quickly share three extensions I forgot I installed but don't want to miss.\nThe newbie first: Better Folding\n\nThe Better Folding extension was released in 2023 and only has a few downloads yet, but after looking at it, I immediately realized that code folding in VS Code could be better.\nVS Code's folding is somehow standing in my way, and that's why I'm not using it that often...\nCheck out \"Better Folding's\" improvements!\nEverything's nicely configurable, too! I bet VS Code will adopt all these folding features when the extension takes off!\nHTML End Tag Labels\n\nAnd speaking of code folding: to navigate nested HTML structures, I used to collapse certain areas to keep an overview. The HTML End Tag Labels extension makes HTML editing so much easier.\nBetter Comments\n\nAnd if a code base comes with lots of comments, Better Comments' TODO highlighting makes it easier to grasp what's essential!\nThat's all for today's VS Code spring cleaning. If you use extensions that blend in as nicely as these three, shoot them my way!\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",

          "description": "The great thing about Git is that almost all actions are reversible! But there's one command that isn't, and it can cause real headaches — git clean.\n# remove all untracked files\ngit clean .\n\nThe clean command removes untracked files from your Git working tree, and while that's sometimes exactly what you want, you should really run the command with caution.\nYou're probably frustrated when you want to start over, but you should be sure you want to throw away everything. Some files might still be valuable. If you run git clean, they're gone — end of story.\nBy default, Git will not allow you to clean up a repository unless you have clean.requireForce set to false. But you know how it is: an innocent -f is quickly added.\nI learned today that git clean (and other commands) support a --dry-run option.\ngit clean --dry-run .\nWould remove not-important.js\nWould remove untracked-but-very-important.js\n\nIf you want a shorter command line option, use the very intuitive (not!) -n argument.\ngit clean -n .\nWould remove not-important.js\nWould remove untracked-but-very-important.js\n\nThe command prints out what it would remove without doing any damage. Handy! It also comes with a useful interactive mode to handle many untracked files.\ngit clean -i\nWould remove the following items:\n  not-important.js   untracked-but-very-important.js\n  \n*** Commands ***\n  1: clean   2: filter by pattern   3: select by numbers   4: ask each   5: quit   6: help\nWhat now> 4\nRemove not-important.js [y/N]? y\nRemove untracked-but-very-important.js [y/N]? N\nRemoving not-important.js\n\nYou can choose between pattern matching or checking each file one by one in the interactive mode. Nice one, Git! 💪\nBut what about other Git commands? Most of the other dry runs don't seem very exciting to me because, as said, most of the Git operations are reversible. But one that I could see come in handy is a git remote prune dry run to avoid removing remote branches. But that's about it. 🤷‍♂️\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",
