          "description": "Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is \"experimental\" due to these caveats:\n\nThis feature is currently only available through custom template.\niTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be \"hh:mm:ss\" or \"mm:ss\" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.\nNo image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.\nYou can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.\nFixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.\nThank you @Zenigata",

If so, it will be truncated into a \"pseudo\" summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.\nThank you: @LooperXX.",

          "description": "ES modules are still reasonably new in Node.js land (they're stable since Node 14). Modules come with a built-in module system and features such as top-level await.\nI just read an informative post on ES modules by Pawel Grzybek and learned that you can't import JSON files in ES modules today. That's a real bummer because I'm pretty used to doing const data = require('./some-file.json') in Node.js.\nWhile it will be possible to import JSON from within modules eventually, the implementation is still behind a flag (--experimental-json-modules).\nThis post includes ways to deal with JSON in ES modules today.\nOption 1: Read and parse JSON files yourself\n\nThe Node.js documentation advises to use the fs module and do the work of reading the files and parsing it yourself.\nimport { readFile } from 'fs/promises';\nconst json = JSON.parse(\n  await readFile(\n    new URL('./some-file.json', import.meta.url)\n  )\n);\n\nOption 2: Leverage the CommonJS require function to load JSON files\n\nThe documentation also states that you can use createRequire to load JSON files. This is the way Pawel advises in his blog post.\ncreateRequire allows you to construct a CommonJS require function so that you can use typical CommonJS features in Node.js EcmaScript modules.\nimport { createRequire } from \"module\";\nconst require = createRequire(import.meta.url);\nconst data = require(\"./data.json\");\n\nHow should you load JSON files?\n\nI don't know. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Neither option feels good, and I'll probably stick to the first option because it's more understandable.\nLet's see when stable JSON modules land in Node.js!\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",
