          "description": "How often do you set margin on absolute positioned elements? I rarely do it and might even say I've never done it. I mean, the whole point of absolute positioning is to place an element in its container. What's there to margin?\nBut while reading Josh Comeau's guide on div centering, I learned a CSS trick that I will remember.\nLet's say you want to center a modal ‚Äî how do you do it?\nFor years, I moved the element to the middle and then moved it back by its half width and height. Et voil√†!\n.box {\n  position: absolute;\n  top: 50%;\n  left: 50%;\n  translate: -50% -50%;\n}\n\nWhile this approach works, it always felt clunky. An alternative is not to rely on absolute positioning with flexbox or grid. And that's fair, but what if we still want to center with position: absolute?\nJosh taught me a nifty magic trick. Check this out. üëá\n[Interactive component: visit the article to see it...]\nMagic!\nBut what's going on here? If I read the Positioned Layout spec correctly, here's what's happening:\nThe size of an absolute positioned element is calculated via its \"inset\" properties (top, left, inset, ...). The resulting box is then called inset-modified containing block.\nA defined preferred size (via width and height) can then limit an element's size inside this containing block. This result is called the used size.\nA defined maximum size (via max-width and max-height) can then overwrite the preferred size, again changing the used size.\nAnd here's the catch: if we now have a containing block defined via inset properties, but the element's used size is not filling it out. Then margin: auto comes into play and distributes the available space on each axis.\nHoly moly!\nThanks, Josh; I'll add this trick to my toolbox!\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",

But there's a problem ‚Äî my side hustle schedule is pretty busy already.\nI want to keep this blog active. I run a weekly web development newsletter. I maintain some open-source projects. I collect online tools.\nThese projects alone eat a good chunk of my free time, and while I love doing them, they add up. There are only so many hours in the day.\nFor years, I ran the @randomMDN Twitter bot. Then Elmo broke the Twitter APIs. I was puzzled. \"This is one of my projects; it can't just be over, can it?\" buzzed in my head. I've had a hard time letting go, I guess.\nFast forward. I hadn't had time to fix or deal with the problem, and it was over. Just like that, one of my projects dropped off the list.\nLovely people ported Random MDN to the Fediverse if you want random web dev facts in your feed.\nI realized I treat most projects as \"forever projects\".\nOf course, I work on this project every week. Of course, I'll answer these GitHub issues over the weekend. Of course, I keep this online resource up-to-date. And, of course, this isn't a sustainable.\nAs Jamie Wilkinson puts it, he doesn't want to do forever projects anymore. Everything has a shelf life. Kicking things off is great, but letting things go is as important.\nTreat beginnings like endings: celebrate them, document them.\nIt's simple: to have time for new projects and passions, one has to let go.\nBy ending well, you give yourself the freedom to begin again.\nGreat advice.\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",
