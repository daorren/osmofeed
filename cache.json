Just by looking at them, every mobile user knows that hitting the right target requires surgical tap precision.\nWhat does GitHub do about these tiny and too-close-to-each-other links?

          "description": "JavaScript is always good for a surprise, isn't it?\nNicholas C. Zakas published a discovery that made my head spin. Do you know the array method every?\nThis is how MDN describes what it does:\nThe every() method of Array instances tests whether all elements in the array pass the test implemented by the provided function. It returns a Boolean value.\nCool, that makes sense.\nconst collection = ['great', 'nope', 'great'];\nconst allItemsAreGreat = collection.every((item) => item === 'great'); // false\n\nBut now, see what happens when you use every with an empty array.\n[].every((item) => item === 'great'); // true\n[].every((item) => item !== 'great'); // true\n\nWhoops?! I didn't expect that every() will tell me that every item matches my condition if there are none. That's not how my brain works.\nWhen using the array method, you have to flip around your mindset. Here's Nicholas:\nI‚Äôd suggest changing the way you read every() calls when you come across them. Instead of reading every() as ‚Äúdoes every item in this array match this condition?‚Äù read it as, ‚Äúis there any item in this array that doesn‚Äôt match this condition?‚Äù.\nAnd it gets every weirder. Check the results for an empty array with some().\n[].some((item) => item === 'great'); // false\n[].some((item) => item !== 'great'); // false\n\nOh boy... Why do the array methods behave that way? The answer is Math, and if you want to dive deeper, check Nicholas' post. üíØ\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",
