          "description": "Here's a quick tip from the excellent vscode.email newsletter: VS Code allows you to mark files as readonly.\nWhen would you use it?\nMany applications include generated files, which could be data models or schemas. These files are often checked into version control and only updated periodically. People know they shouldn't touch these files because they start with a big warning ‚Äî do not edit this file manually.\nHere's a file from my current project.\n/**\n * ...\n *\n * NOTE: This class is auto generated by OpenAPI Generator (https://openapi-generator.tech).\n * https://openapi-generator.tech\n * Do not edit the class manually.\n */\n\nDo people read all the comments? No. Does this prevent me from changing the file manually? Also, no.\nI love the idea of solving this problem at the editor level.\nThe \"Readonly include\" option accepts files or glob patterns.\nAnd voila! I can't edit these generated files in VS Code anymore now.\nThe trick is not to define this setting in your global config but rather in your workspace or project config at your-project/.vscode/settings.json.\n{\n  \"files.readonlyInclude\": {\n    \"src/app/core/generated-models/**\": true\n  }\n}\n\nNow, no VS Code user will edit the generated files.

But there's a problem ‚Äî my side hustle schedule is pretty busy already.\nI want to keep this blog active. I run a weekly web development newsletter. I maintain some open-source projects. I collect online tools.\nThese projects alone eat a good chunk of my free time, and while I love doing them, they add up. There are only so many hours in the day.\nFor years, I ran the @randomMDN Twitter bot. Then Elmo broke the Twitter APIs. I was puzzled. \"This is one of my projects; it can't just be over, can it?\" buzzed in my head. I've had a hard time letting go, I guess.\nFast forward. I hadn't had time to fix or deal with the problem, and it was over. Just like that, one of my projects dropped off the list.\nLovely people ported Random MDN to the Fediverse if you want random web dev facts in your feed.\nI realized I treat most projects as \"forever projects\".\nOf course, I work on this project every week. Of course, I'll answer these GitHub issues over the weekend. Of course, I keep this online resource up-to-date. And, of course, this isn't a sustainable.\nAs Jamie Wilkinson puts it, he doesn't want to do forever projects anymore. Everything has a shelf life. Kicking things off is great, but letting things go is as important.\nTreat beginnings like endings: celebrate them, document them.\nIt's simple: to have time for new projects and passions, one has to let go.\nBy ending well, you give yourself the freedom to begin again.\nGreat advice.\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",

With very creative iframe usage.\n<iframe hidden name=htmz onload=\"setTimeout(()=>document.querySelector(this.contentWindow.location.hash||null)?.replaceWith(...this.contentDocument.body.childNodes))\"></iframe>\n\n<!-- Loads /flower.html onto #my-element -->\n<a href=\"/flower.html#my-element\" target=htmz>Flower</a>\n\nIs the project a joke?
