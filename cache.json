          "description": "I've been writing JavaScript for so long that I sometimes don't see its quirks. To be fair, there are fewer quirks than ten years ago, but some things would still make great language additions. One thing that would make a lot of sense is required function parameters.\nAssume you have a function that defines required arguments. And you really really want to make sure the function is called with the correct arguments by throwing an error.\nHere's what you might do:\nfunction doSomethingWithAThing(theThing) {\n  if (typeof theThing === \"undefined\") {\n    throw new Error(\"theThing is required\");\n  }\n}\n\nThat's quite a bit of code for such a simple thing.\nUnfortunately, you can't do something like this in JavaScript ...\nfunction doSomethingWithAThing(\n  theThing = throw new Error(\"theThing Is Undefined\")\n) {\n  // ...\n}\n\n... because JavaScript doesn't like it.\nPeter Kröner published a handy snippet that he carries around from project to project. The post is in German, so here's the English gist of it.\nFirst, define a fail function.\nfunction fail(reason, ErrorConstructor = Error) {\n  throw new ErrorConstructor(reason);\n}\n\nAnd second... use it. 🫣\nBy restructuring the code and transforming the error throwing portion into an expression, you can immediately throw in case a function is called without the required parameters.\nfunction doSomethingWithAThing(\n  theThing = fail('theThing Is Undefined')\n) {\n  // ...\n}\n\nWhat a beautiful sort of one-line workaround.\nThanks Peter!\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",

Or do you use rel=\"tag\" somewhere?\nAll the answers and much more are included in this week's Web Weekly. 🫣\nRegarding forms, you should rely on the native form elements because they provide the best user experience, right?\nI remember being overly excited when Safari finally started supporting date inputs two years ago.\nBut are these native elements really always the best choice?\nRobin Thomas shared multiple reasons why the iOS date picker sucks. And I can relate — filling in a date on mobile sometimes feels like this CodePen.\nBut what about the other elements?

          "description": "Did you ever curse the JSON data format for not allowing comments and wondered what the heck? Yeah, same here.\nSurprisingly, JSON, in its initial spec, did allow comments, but comment support was removed for three reasons:\nPeople put parsing instructions into comments breaking portability across platforms and languages.\nComments introduced complexity that might not be needed for a data format.\nThe JSON creators wanted it to be compatible with early YAML versions.\nIt's a bummer because JSON outgrew its serial data use case, and it's widespread to have JSON config files these days. :/\nPawel Grzybek pointed out that the lack of comments and other features led to the JSON5 spec, which aimed to be a JSON extension suitable for config files and was adopted by VS Code and many other software products today.\nIf you want to learn more, here's why comments were removed on YouTube.\n\n\n          \n          \n            Reply to Stefan",

Unfortunately, my Google foo failed me.
