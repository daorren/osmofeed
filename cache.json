          "description": "As far as I see, it's time to ditch hsl() and use oklch() for color palettes and design systems. Why's that?\nFor me, it boils down to two reasons.\nNew devices and monitors can display colors that aren't defined in the sRGB color space used by rgb(), hsl() or hex colors. Isn't it sad that you can't express these vibrant colors in CSS using existing color methods?\nIt is. And the solution are new CSS color functions that can talk new and fancy monitor tech (namely wide-gamut P3 colors). It's party time y'all ‚Äî the web gets a color update with fresh and vibrant colors.\nThere's oklch(), oklab() and also color() to target the wider color space, but let's focus on oklch() because it's the most user-friendly.\noklch()'s parameters (lightness, chroma and hue) are easy to grasp and feel very similar ‚Ä¶",

Are you ready to adopt native and relaxed CSS nesting?\nThis week's Web Weekly includes all the answers and much more. Enjoy!\nI heard having your own font is important for successful tech companies these days. Vercel followed the playbook and released Geist.\nShortly after, GitHub followed. But the Octocat maintainers didn't release yet another standard coding font, but rather an entire font family ‚Äî say hello to \"Monaspace\".\nMonaspace is a set of five variable fonts supporting the same font axes.

With the fat finger problem, navigating complex sites can be a pain. And the same goes for GitHub. The account owner and repository home link are super close to each other in the header. Just by looking at them, every mobile user knows that hitting the right target requires surgical tap precision.\nWhat does GitHub do about these tiny and too-close-to-each-other links? Change the design? Obviously not. They change the UI functionality entirely and put the account owner and repository into a button.\nThe button then opens a modal that asks where you want to go. Smart.\nWhat's a good target size, though?\nThe freshly released Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WC‚Ä¶",
