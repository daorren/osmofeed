          "description": "I was kneedeep into CI/CD scripting, when I hit a wall. You can't just do simple math like adding or subtracting integers in a shell environment? How could I have not discovered this fact before?\nAs it turns out, simple operations like summing and subtracting two variables need some serious shell knowledge.\nHere's the problem.\n#!/bin/sh\n\na=1\nb=2\nc=$a+$b\necho $c # 1+2\n\nWhen evaluating c, $a and $b are resolved to their values (1 and 2), but the + is treated as a string. All three parts are strings, and now the result is 1+2. Ufff.\nAfter researching this problem, I learned that there are multiple ways to do math in shell environments. Let's find out what I learned!\nThe expr command\n\nLet's start with my first Google result — expr.\n#!/bin/sh\n\na=1\nb=2\nc=`expr $a + $b`\n\necho $c #3\n\nBackticks and…",

And I miss them.\nSo here's an idea: I'd love to include you and add a section that looks like this:\n[YOUR NAME] listens to \"[BAND] — [Title]\" and says:\n\n\"I just love how bouncy this track is!\"\n\nAre you game? If so, let me know!\nLast week, I shared \"Dark Visitors\" — a site listing known AI agents.  And there are a lot! Knowing about them is good, but what should we do with this info?
