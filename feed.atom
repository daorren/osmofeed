        <link href="https://www.stefanjudis.com/notes/how-to-show-typescript-type-annotations-in-code-snippets/"/>
        <updated>2023-08-09T22:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes, I blog about TypeScript, and I always wondered if it's possible to render type annotations in syntax-highlighted code snippets on this blog.
Previous Google searches didn't help me, so here's another contribution to the internet: I finally found a project that allows rendering type annotations in code snippets.
Say hello to "Shiki Twoslash"

Twoslash allows you to add TypeScript type information to your code snippets. In their words, Twoslash is:
markdown code samples powered by the syntax engine of Visual Studio Code
mixed with the TypeScript compiler’s information.
And that's pretty incredible, because it's also able to validate your code and show possible Typescript errors.
ts

interface Person {
  name: string
}
 
interface Person {
  age: number
}
 
// `Person` is now merged and expects `name` and `age`
const p: Person = {
Property 'name' is missing in type '{ age: number; }' but required in type 'Person'.2741Property 'name' is missing in type '{ age: number; }' but required in type 'Person'.
  age: 99
}


You can let Twoslash do its job; if your snippets aren't correct, it'll complain and error out (unless you tell it that you expect an error like above).
And because it uses the VS Code type checker, it works for JavaScript snippets, too!
js

const a = {
  joo: 'test'
};
 
console.log(a.foo);
Property 'foo' does not exist on type '{ joo: string; }'.2339Property 'foo' does not exist on type '{ joo: string; }'.

And then, you can use some fancy markdown syntax to inspect variables and even show possible auto-completion values.
js

const a = {
  test: 'test'
  testTwo: 'test'
  testThree: 'test'
};
 
console.log(a.te
                
test
testThree
testTwo

Wild! 🤯
I'm not entirely convinced I'll use Twoslash for every code snippet on the blog, but for TypeScript snippets — heck yeah!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How do you replace an array element at a given index?
Is this a trick question? Not really.
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
numbers[1] = 'new value';
console.log(numbers); // [1, 'new value', 3, 4, 5]

But when you're using React or any framework betting on immutability, just changing an array entry will lead to subtle bugs because the array will still be the same object with the same reference. In an immutable world, data updates always have to result in a new object reference.
How can you change an array element via its index and spit out a new array in the same go then? A 12-years-old Stack Overflow question with 1.5m views has tons of advice, but because it's so old and has hundreds of upvotes, it's not showing the most modern solution in the top area.

How many units are defined in CSS? Is Jamstack dead? Or how can you detect Emojis in JavaScript strings?
This week's Web Weekly includes all the answers and much more. Enjoy!
Tricky question: what domains do you own? If you own country code top-level domains such as .af (Afghanistan), .io (British Indian Ocean Territory) or .gg ( Bailiwick of Guernsey), here's a reminder to maybe move to a "boring" .com domain instead.
Web Bos and Jason Lengstorf have issues with .af. And I've read plenty of reports from people losing domain access lately.
From friend to friend: you better pick a safe over a fancy domain, you know? 😅

✍️ It feels like there's a particularly strong drive to improve Go lately, whether it's through the ever growing number of proposals from folks like Russ Cox, the development of tools like govulncheck, or folks writing articles about how to write better code. Go's a simple language with modest ambitions, but it's not resting on its laurels and is actively continuing to get better all the time – long may it last!
