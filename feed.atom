Have you ever used custom elements without JavaScript? Or do you know that there's an SVG view element? Or that you can use the caption-side CSS property with HTML tables?
All the answers and much more are included in this week's Web Weekly. 🙈 Enjoy!
Thought of the week

I didn't think it would happen, but Elon has taken over Twitter. I can't imagine what happens next after his weird sink move, immediately firing execs and making developers print out source code. 🤦‍♂️ The satire is real by now.
I'm still deciding whether to move off it, but I did check out the Feediverse and created a mastodon.social account.
But isn't this all super complicated? Yeah, I thought the same, but it's honestly not that bad!
My first misbelief was that people could only follow people on the same M…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some people love custom elements, and it seems that even more people are entirely against them. And while I'm leaning towards using them, today I learned a fascinating custom elements take.
I've been reading one of Adam Argyle's excellent component walk-throughs, and Adam shared a tool-tip custom element that works without the usual customElements.define JavaScript instruction.
To quote Adam:
You could think of a custom element like a classname with less specificity.
That's an interesting take because it changes the mental model around custom elements! Custom elements are usually used to encapsulate functionality as web components with JavaScript, but one could also use them as another style hook with lower specificity than class selectors. Neat!
Use Polypane's specificity calculator if you want to learn more about CSS specificity.
And to make the custom element accessible, Adam's example tool-tip component receives its semantic meaning via ARIA...
<tool-tip role="tooltip">A tooltip</tool-tip>

... and the show/hide functionality is then added via CSS has(). 😲
/* Only show the custom element when its parent is hovered, focused, or activated */
:has(> tool-tip):is(:hover, :focus-visible, :active) > tool-tip {
 opacity: 1;
 transition-delay: 200ms;
}

Very smart!

This week's Web Weekly comes to you from a lovely terrace in Greece. I spent the last few days mountain biking, driving on tiny streets, and hiking, and right now, I'm looking down at the Mediterranean Sea.
Life's good because I'm taking the much-needed break from being a tad too busy for a little too long. Nevertheless, I love writing this newsletter, so let's get to it!
You might have heard of MPAs and SPAs — but have you heard of PEMPAs and PESPAs? Or did you consider that Copilot might be toxic for open source communities? And do you know that there's an HTTP header to clear localstorage?
All the answers and much more are included in this week's Web Weekly. 🙈 Enjoy!
Welcome to the 34 new subscribers! I'm super excited to have you around! 👋

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not too long ago, I was looking into refactoring my site to go all in with CSS grid!
I've been aiming for a classical centered blog layout with flexible side margins. The content should be 65 characters wide at max. But (!) I wanted to be able to break free, and some components should go full-width by setting a class. And it should all work with CSS grid.
After fiddling with it for a while, I didn't reach a satisfying result and decided to do it another day. In the meantime, Ryan Mulligan's post "Layout Breakouts with CSS Grid" provided the CSS solution I was looking for (see it in action on CodePen).
The solution: named grid-template-columns and some math

Put all your content in a content wrapper element that defines named grid areas:
.content {
  --gap: clamp(1rem, 6vw, 3rem);
  --full: minmax(var(--gap), 1fr);
  --content: min(50ch, 100% - var(--gap) * 2);
  --popout: minmax(0, 2rem);
  --feature: minmax(0, 5rem);

  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns:
    [full-start] var(--full)
    [feature-start] var(--feature)
    [popout-start] var(--popout)
    [content-start] var(--content) [content-end]
    var(--popout) [popout-end]
    var(--feature) [feature-end]
    var(--full) [full-end];
}

And then control all the component widths using grid template areas. 💯
.content > * {
  grid-column: content;
}
.popout {
  grid-column: popout;
}
.feature {
  grid-column: feature;
}
.full {
  grid-column: full;
}

The post even includes a beautiful visualization that explains what's going on. 👏
I love it. 💙 Thank you, Ryan!

Proposal: A try Statement for Error Handling? — Inspired by the results of the recent Go community survey, a self-proclaimed if err != nil expert(!) puts forward an interesting, well-written proposal for adding some tasty syntactic sugar to error handling. It’s only early days for this idea which may well not even pan out, but there’s plenty of room to jump in with your take on it and help push things forward.

How Do You Solve a Problem Like for Loop Variables? — Russ Cox began a discussion about what changes could be made to Go to resolve a tripping point around per-iteration vs per-loop binding of variables in loops – an issue first raised five years ago and common enough to be in Go’s FAQ.
