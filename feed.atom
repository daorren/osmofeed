Ciao friends!
How's your week been? Surprisingly, I spent my Friday night on a rooftop terrace looking at the TV tower listening to chilled house music. It was beautiful!
Before we jump into web stuff, here's a pupper from my hidden collection. Look at this energy bundle! 😆

          
            
This week's Web Weekly includes:
Nerdy URL facts
A CodePen embed alternative
How styled components work
... and, as always, GitHub repositories, a new Tiny Helper and some music.
Ready? Steady. Go!
How a reframed question can change its outcome





          
            
Look at these two questions:
"Are you facing any challenges?"
"What challenges are you facing right now?"
Both questions ask for the same information, but they probably lead to very different resul…]]></summary>

        <link href="https://www.stefanjudis.com/today-i-learned/how-to-find-all-internal-pages-in-chromiums-and-firefox/"/>
        <updated>2021-06-27T14:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just read the article "URLs: It's complicated..." and learned a few nifty tricks about internal pages in Chromies (Edge, Chrome, etc.) and Firefox.
You might know about the hidden browser games in Chrome (chrome://dino/) and Edge (edge://surf/), or the commonly used browser flags pages (chrome://flags, edge://flags and so on).




          
            
Let's have a look at three things that make internal page handling easier!
Use about instead of your specific browser scheme

As described on web.dev, Chromium browsers rewrite not-matching browser schemes, if you enter an incorrect one. You can access chrome://flags in Edge and it'll be rewritten to edge://flags. That's already pretty handy, but there's more!
You can also use the about scheme to "resolve" to the correct browser scheme. about://flags becomes chrome://flags, brave://flags, or edge://flags depending on your browser. This rewrite is a great addition and I made it a habit to use about for all internal pages already!
You can leave out the //

While playing around with the about pages, I noticed that you can make the URL even shorter. Enter about:flags and it's correctly resolved to chrome://flags. That's pretty nice, too!
about:about – a list of all internal pages

And here's the kicker, if you wonder what internal pages your Chromium browser or Firefox provides, you can enter about:about...





          
            
And there you have it, about:about lists all internal pages! I'll continue poking around all these pages now. 👋
Pssst... If you like these short learnings, I send out a weekly newsletter.

Hola friends!
Oh well... Let me be honest, my week was very long; I felt super low, binge-watched Netflix the entire weekend, and the 30+°C here in Berlin didn't help. It was pretty challenging to sit down and write this week's newsletter (but I couldn't break the 24-week streak 🙈).
I hope you had a better week and are getting ready for the summer. We all deserve it!
Before we jump into web stuff, here's a pupper from my hidden collection. It's just too cute how she leaves the scene. 😊


          
            
This week's Web Weekly includes:
GraphQL terms explained
CSS overscroll-behavior
Error cause in JavaScript
... and, as always, GitHub repositories, a new Tiny Helper and some music.
Ready? Steady. Go!
What's holding you back from being confident?

Before we jump into web stuff, let me share something fascinating with you, this video shows the creation of a beautiful animation without using a computer.


          
            
This week's Web Weekly includes:
JSON modules in JavaScript
Lighthouse updates
CSS Font descriptors
... and, as always, GitHub repositories, a new Tiny Helper and some music.
Ready? Steady. Go!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I learned something exciting from Jim Nielsen today. Jim shared that CSS defines system color values that follow the system color preferences (light and dark mode). If you want to learn more about the nitty-gritty details, read his post or have a look at the CSS Color Module Level 4 specification.
This post shares my discoveries after playing around with system color values such as Canvas and CanvasText.
You can find all defined system color values in the example below. Change your color preferences and see the colors below adjust!

You can see the colors react to system preferences in Chrome and Safari in the video below, too.
Here are a few things I noticed. 👇
At the time of writing, it appears that only Chromies' and Safari's system color values take the system preferences into conside…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're using EcmaScript modules, you probably know the problem that you can't "just" import JSON files. To import and load a JSON file in an ES module, you have to do a "window.fetch dance" to request the file and parse it yourself. It's not great...
But there's hope! According to chromestatus.com, JSON Modules are shipping in Chrome 91. I gave it a quick try, and surprisingly, the following JavaScript code does not work.
<script type="module">
  import data from "./data.json";
  console.log(data);
</script>

It throws the following exception in Chrome 91:
Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript module script but the server responded with a MIME type of "application/json". Strict MIME type checking is enforced for module scripts per HTML spec.
I didn't have a detailed look at the spec discussion about this topic, but apparently, the new syntax to import JSON Modules is the following. 😲
import data from "./data.json" assert { type: "json" };

console.log(data);

That's quite something, and I have to do some reading about it. But hey, anything that makes it easier to import JSON is more than welcome!
And when there's a solution in Chrome, it can't be long until it ships in Node.js because importing JSON files in Node ES modules is not great either. 🙈
Edit: Axel Rauschmayer shared that JSON import are based on import assertions and you can read more about it on his blog.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Welcome to Web Weekly #21!

Hello friends! I'm a few hours late because I had such a lovely weekend. I saw some friends, listened to music and read an entertaining book. 😊 It felt like the first "somewhat normal" weekend for ages here in Berlin. I hope this madness is getting to an end where you live, too!
Before we jump into web stuff, let me share with you what made me smile this week. If you're into dogs (or trampolines), this video is just too cute.

This week's Web Weekly includes:
cutting-edge CSS features
the soon-to-be cross-browser supported requestSubmit method
the address HTML element
... and, as always, GitHub repositories, a new Tiny Helper and some music.
Ready? Steady. Go!
Things to not do yourself – email address validation

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This post is a quick reference for my future self. I implemented the eleventy cache assets plugin to speed up my local development last weekend. This site is based on API data from several sources, and unfortunately, local development became terribly slow. It was time for some optimization. The problem was that the local build process fetched all the API data on every file change and local rebuild.
The eleventy cache plugin helps here. It caches data across builds and writes the API data into files in a .cache directory. When the site rebuilds, the cached data is reused, and no APIs will be called during the build process.
To make the plugin work in a remote environment such as Netlify, it needs the .cache directory to be available. This behavior led to the problem that I had to check in the .cache directory but needed to ignore all the included files.
I ran into this exact problem many times, and it always takes me several attempts to get it right. Here's the solution that worked for me.
First, add the directory to your local project and place a .gitignore file in it.
.cache
  |_ .gitignore

Then, paste the following configuration into the .gitignore file in the directory you want to check in.
# File: .cache/.gitignore
# Ignore everything in this directory
*
# Except for this file
!.gitignore

And voilà! Commit the .gitignore file at folder-you-want-to-check-in/.gitignore, and that's it! The directory is now available in git and files in this directory will be ignored.
It's to point out that .gitignore files work in sub-directories and allow you to configure git on a sub-directory level. And that's pretty handy!
