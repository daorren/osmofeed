        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ahmad Shadeed's post Conditional Border Radius In CSS is a wonderful example of CSS trickery that explains a fairly cryptic CSS snippet found on facebook.com.
.conditional-border-radius {
   border-radius: max(0px, min(8px, calc((100vw - 4px - 100%) * 9999)));
}

This snippet is quite hefty CSS, and if you want to learn how it works first, head over to read Ahmad's post. It's a good hack, but it is also unreadable. Even if you understand this border-radius declaration today, you have to write a lengthy comment so that your future self won't travel back in time to have a word with you.
If you describe the CSS' functionality in JavaScript, that's how it would look like.
if (cardWidth >= viewportWidth) {
  radius = 0;
} else {
  radius = 8px;
}

That's reasonable logic! It's readable and easy…]]></summary>

That's why I spend a lot of time looking for files, and I leverage Chrome's URL bar to find them with their filename.




          
            
Chrome's URL bar suggestions include previously opened URLs and files (great 👍), but also search query suggestions and links to "related and useful" sites (not so great 👎). These smart suggestions are just in my way, and I tried to figure out how to disable them after an unsuccessful Google search.
Thanks to Leif, I now know that the "turn off autosuggestions" setting is buried in the sync section (chrome://settings/syncSetup).


          
            
And now look at that. 👇 Much better! 🎉

What's up, party people? Last week I spent some time implementing a Firefox-only feature on my website (it's a minimap). And I'm super into it! We need more fancy browser UI functionality.
Apart from that, I have a busy week ahead because I'll be running a Jamstack conf workshop about Next.js and Contentful. Come and say Hi!
This week's Web Weekly includes:
Innovative browser UI patterns.
A new proposal for CSS conditionals.
Colorful scrollbars.
... and, as always, GitHub repositories, a new Tiny Helper and some music.
Quick links

Container queries will also have new CSS units.
Chrome is approaching version 100, and people are already testing if that will break things (it does).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just had a look at the current Chromium DevTools experiments (Chrome and Edge) and enabled three handy new features. Let's have a look!
How to enable Chromium experiments

First, how do you enable Chromium experiments?
You can either hit the little gear icons in the top-right corner and navigate to "Experiments". As a heavy keyboard user, I preview the shortcut way: open the command palette with CMD + Shift + p and go directly to the experiments menu.





          
            
Look at all these possibly upcoming Chromium DevTools features and play around with them. That's why they're there!
CSS Overview






          
            
There are many CSS analysis tools out there, but having them right in your developer tools is super handy. The CSS overview lists defined colors and media queries, used fonts and useless CSS declarations. It's time to clean up your CSS!
Warnings about low contrast text




          
            
Low contrast text is one of the most common accessibility issues. Tools like Lighthouse check for these when you scan your site, but wouldn't it be great if the DevTools would tell you about issues right away? I (and the Chromium DevTools folks) think so, too, and that's why you can enable "Contrast issue reporting" to see warnings in your console. 💯
A new font editor tool





          
            
I always found it hard to define and style custom fonts. The new font editor helps with that and allows to change font settings with a visual UI!
I love all this new DevTools functionality and can't wait to see what's next!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was a huge CodePen fan in the past, but lately, I prefer my local development environment for creating quick demos and tryouts. I'm so used to my VS Code setup that I don't want to miss it.
To not fill my computer with random "throw away files", I usually create projects in the /tmp directory, test something out and forget about the files because they'll be deleted automatically.
I rarely need to clean up my computer; if you want to learn how to avoid an overflowing Downloads directory or a desktop full of screenshots on macOS, check this blog post.
Today I discovered the CodeSwing VS Code extension. It's like a local CodePen and precisely what I needed. It quickly spins up a demo environment, includes a snappy browser preview and automatically cleans up the files. It's beautiful!




          
            
Find CodeSwing on the VS Code marketplace or, if you want to learn more, read Bramus' blog post about it.

Hello everyone! How has your week been? I had some time to work on my website, ran a new 10km best time (5:15 min/km), and read many nerdy articles. It was a good week, and I hope the same applies to you!
This week's Web Weekly includes:
Browser and VS Code extensions.
A new proposal for native browser prerendering.
Why you shouldn't argue with strangers on the internet.
... and, as always, GitHub repositories, a new Tiny Helper and some music.
Something that made me smile

I loved this Tweet (and project) from 2018 and will adopt the term VPG from now on! 😆

So, how was your week, friends? I had had a super chilled weekend and had some time to polish some styles on my website. The CSS architecture is such a mess; luckily, only I work on it (YOLO!). Apart from that, I'll be on a Contentful webinar next week, and maybe you want to say Hi!
This week's Web Weekly includes:
Resources to level up your VS Code game.
A project that generates videos with React.
Reasons to step into leadership.
... and, as always, GitHub repositories, a new Tiny Helper and some music.
Something that made me smile

But before we jump into the nerdy things, let me show you what made me laugh this week, and let's look at these weirds books that you can order on Amazon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I still define my CSS colors in hex values. 💪 rgb(), rgba(), hsl() and hsla() are valuable CSS functions, but it's so cumbersome to convert hex values (#34aa44) to numbers or percentages. That's why I never adopted the color functions.
The spec even includes a section explaining how to convert RGB to HSL and vice versa.
My rare usage is why I missed that the CSS Color Module Level 4 spec made rgba() and hsla() redundant.
The specification introduced two changes:
rgb()/hsl() accept alpha values.
Color functions accept space-separared values.
With rgb()/hsl() accepting transparency values, hsla() and rgba() became legacy functions and are now aliases for rgb()/hsl().
If you worry about browser support, check MDN. rgb()/hsl() transparency values are well supported!
The second edition is a new space-separated syntax, that improves readability:
/* evolution of the rgb function with transparency */
rgba(255, 255, 255, 50%)
rgba(255 255 255 / 50%)
rgb(255 255 255 / 50%)

/* evolution of the hsl function with transparency */
hsla(235, 100%, 50%, 50%)

These two new features made color handling easier! You don't have to worry about color functions that do or don't support transparency, and the space/slash syntax highlights seperates values and makes it easier to read. I love it when CSS becomes more precise!

Do you know these beautiful coding themes with fancy-looking cursive fonts? 👇



          
            
I was always jealous of people using them, and today I spent some time figuring out how that works.
A font with cursive characters and a theme using italics

You need two things to enable a cursive font in your editor:
a coding theme that leverages italics for particular tokens (not many do)
a font that is primarily monospaced but includes cursive characters for italics
My VS Code setup consists of the Yi light/dark coding theme and the FiraCode editor font. And, unfortunately, Yi doesn't use italics and FireCode doesn't include cursive charact…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today I learned that the color theme I use (Yi color theme) does not support semantic syntax highlighting. Semantic what?
Semantic syntax highlighting makes sure your source code is not only beautifully colored, but that used the colors are logical, too.
After learning about this feature, I discovered that my editor's syntax highlighting is very confusing. Functions, methods, arguments and parameters change their color from line to line. I wonder how I never noticed this chaos!
But thanks to VS Code, you can enforce semantic highlighting using the editor.semanticHighlighting.enabled setting (read more in the VS Code docs) so that syntactic tokens don't change colors constantly! 🎉

          
            
I turned it on for now. Let's find out if code is easier to grasp or if my brain needs unlogical always changing colors. 🤷‍♂️
