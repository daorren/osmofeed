        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You might think that when you bet on the web platform and rely on native HTML features, your website will be completely accessible. Unfortunately, this assumption is wrong in many cases.
If you want to learn about more inaccessible HTML features, a recent HTMHell article covered many of them. It's a great read!
This week, I've learned that even simple things, such as linking to local elements via id (<a href="#something">), require careful consideration not to cause accessibility problems.
What's the issue with local links?

I've been reading How To Avoid Breaking Web Pages For Keyboard Users and learned that some assistive technologies rely on document.activeElement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, hello friends! ðŸ‘‹

How can you quickly find out if a web feature is safe to use? Does the definition of the sizes attribute really have to be so painful? And now that we're close to wrapping up 2023, what new features should you start learning?
This week's Web Weekly includes all the answers and much more. Enjoy!
Let's kick off this Web Weekly with some short'n'sweet HTML form trivia!
I was reading the excellent HTMHell advents calendar and discovered a nifty fun fact.
Did you know that a button can submit a form even though it's not included in one?
Put a button somewhere on the page, and reference the form to submit by id â€” done! The form attribute can be invaluable when your design requires submitting a form on the other side of the page. ðŸ˜…
But today's trivia doesn't stop here!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[David Darnes shared a nifty tiny trick to build a "scroll to top" component that automatically shows up after you scroll down a little.
And thanks to modern CSS, position: sticky is all you need. ðŸ’™
Here's a scroll-top link in action. ðŸ‘‡
[Interactive component: visit the article to see it...]
But why use 100vh instead of 100%?
Fun fact: percentages in margin-top refer to the logical width of the containing block. margin-top: 50% isn't half the container's height, but width.
Either way, this is a nifty little CSS trick. Thank David!
