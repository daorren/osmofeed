Do you notice the performance impact of inline SVGs and are looking for solutions? Do you wonder how to evaluate the performance impact of an npm package? Or are you confused about self-closing HTML tags such as <br> (or is it <br />?) and need to know when to use which?
This week's Web Weekly includes all the answers and much more. 🫣
You might have noticed that I took a three-week-long Web Weekly break. The main reason was that I traveled to Canada to give a new talk — Back to boring (part two). And I had such a blast with countless wonderful people! 💙
During the talk prep, I finally made it to play around with view transitions. And this stuff is nothing but incredible. Only a bit of vanilla spaghetti JavaScript (example CodePen) is needed to transition elements from A to…]]></summary>

🤯 Jake Archibald published a real banger getting into the argument of self-closing HTML elements, and it's more than worth a read.
Here's the tl;dr!
Self-closing elements are mostly a relict from the XHTML era. XHTML was this unforgiving friend who made a massive scene about everything. It required developers to write 100% correct markup. Not cool — we all make mistakes, r…]]></summary>

Well, Manuel Matuzović investigated this topic and it's because of Safari. Safari isn't able to focus zero-size elements.
That's a nice little fun fact! 😅 Thanks Manuel!

A Rationale for Using Coroutines in Go — Many of the initial reactions to this suggestion by Russ Cox to introduce coroutines to Go were negative, with folks instead preferring Go’s existing channels based approach for the problems coroutines can solve. Nonetheless, there are some interesting and specific use cases for coroutines in Go, such as when iterating over generic collections, and Russ tries to convince us of their merit here. Luckily, it's all possible "without language changes".

Frequently Asked Questions About Go — Did you know there's an official Go FAQ? It's been around forever, but somehow we’d not run into it it before.. 😅 It’s packed with interesting stuff and worth a flip through. Some of our favorites:


What compiler technology is used to build the compilers?
Is there an official Go style guide?
Why does Go do garbage collection?

Harry just made a case for considering monitoring DomContentLoad, too! It's a good piece on browser events and how to get your hands on improving web performance.
And while reading it, I discovered another browser event that I probably have known about but left my memory — DomInteractive.
[DomInteractive] is the moment the browser has finished parsing all synchronous DOM work: your HTML and all blocking scripts it encountered on the way. Basically, the browser is now at the </html> tag. The browser is ready to run your deferred JavaScript.
The DomInteractive event can come in handy when evaluating your JS payloads' execution time. But I won't repeat Harry's insights here, so head over to his blog. The post is a nice deep dive!

Go 1.21 Release Candidate — Despite merely being in RC (the final release is expected in August), Go 1.21 fever is high right now. Set to be the biggest release since 1.18, there are a lot of good reasons to be excited this time, including:


The new log/slog package for structured logging.
A preview of a change to for loop variable semantics.

Improvements to type inference for generic functions.
Profile Guided Optimization (PGO) going GA.

Are you desperately waiting for CSS state queries? Do you wonder how to speed up your sites? Or do you want to know how to build web apps that work on flaky connections?
This week's Web Weekly includes all the answers and much more. 🫣
Roman Komarov published a real CSS custom property head-scratcher.
I mean, look at it! 🤯
The article describes how you can use cyclic CSS properties as value toggles. I'm amazed (and confused)!
It's a good explainer of the custom property inner workings.
And while being fancy, I wouldn't use this approach, because it's too clever. But hey, it's good to know about these tricks!
Nevertheless, Roman's blog is worth a follow because it's full of these nerdy CSS techniques. Here's another post about fit-to-width text with pure CSS…]]></summary>

I installed plenty of event emitter libraries over the years, and if I felt advanterous I wrote them from scratch as a quick coding exercise.
Today I learned that vanilla JavaScript comes with a native event emitter, which I've been indirectly using forever. There's no need for extra code!
The EventTarget interface

It's right in front of us; every time you use addEventListener on a DOM element, you subscribe to events from it. That's a classical event emitter. Can you reuse this functionality somehow?
I've always thought that addEventListener is part of the HTMLElement's prototype, but surprisingly it's not!
