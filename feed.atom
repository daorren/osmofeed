Hello friends! I'm a few hours late because I had such a lovely weekend. I saw some friends, listened to music and read an entertaining book. 😊 It felt like the first "somewhat normal" weekend for ages here in Berlin. I hope this madness is getting to an end where you live, too!
Before we jump into web stuff, let me share with you what made me smile this week. If you're into dogs (or trampolines), this video is just too cute.

This week's Web Weekly includes:
cutting-edge CSS features
the soon-to-be cross-browser supported requestSubmit method
the address HTML element
... and, as always, GitHub repositories, a new Tiny Helper and some music.
Ready? Steady. Go!
Things to not do yourself – email address validation

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This post is a quick reference for my future self. I implemented the eleventy cache assets plugin to speed up my local development last weekend. This site is based on API data from several sources, and unfortunately, local development became terribly slow. It was time for some optimization. The problem was that the local build process fetched all the API data on every file change and local rebuild.
The eleventy cache plugin helps here. It caches data across builds and writes the API data into files in a .cache directory. When the site rebuilds, the cached data is reused, and no APIs will be called during the build process.
To make the plugin work in a remote environment such as Netlify, it needs the .cache directory to be available. This behavior led to the problem that I had to check in the .cache directory but needed to ignore all the included files.
I ran into this exact problem many times, and it always takes me several attempts to get it right. Here's the solution that worked for me.
First, add the directory to your local project and place a .gitignore file in it.
.cache
  |_ .gitignore

Then, paste the following configuration into the .gitignore file in the directory you want to check in.
# File: .cache/.gitignore
# Ignore everything in this directory
*
# Except for this file
!.gitignore

And voilà! Commit the .gitignore file at folder-you-want-to-check-in/.gitignore, and that's it! The directory is now available in git and files in this directory will be ignored.
It's to point out that .gitignore files work in sub-directories and allow you to configure git on a sub-directory level. And that's pretty handy!

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be "hh:mm:ss" or "mm:ss" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.

Hello friends! Do you remember last week? I was so proud of sending this tiny newsletter to 1000 people for the first time. In the previous seven days, 200 more people signed up. 😲 I'm so grateful and excited to have you all read along! A big welcome to all the new subscribers!
Before we jump into web stuff, let me share with you what made me laugh this week. Check out this URL lengthener (yes, you read that right!): the idea, the URL, the wording... I love everything about this random project. 🙈


          
            
This week's Web Weekly includes:

The script in question included the following lines:

You probably know the situation. You're trying to develop a shell script. It won't be pretty but hopefully gets the job done. You google how to use an if or how to run a loop. You're probably frustrated (I was at least), and you don't realize that your script could mess with your machine's file system because you're fiddling around with rm -rf.
You always have to be very careful when using rm -rf! Things can go particularly wrong when you use rm in combination with variables. Let's imaging my fat fingers comment out the first line and I run this script. My rm -rf plugins/ command just be…]]></summary>

The exciting part is that it supports auto-completion to pass paths to projects with a working npm run dev command quickly.
A shell function to run multiple commands

To define a custom shell function that runs various commands add the following lines to your .zshrc or .bashrc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ES modules are still reasonably new in Node.js land (they're stable since Node 14). Modules come with a built-in module system and features such as top-level await.
I just read an informative post on ES modules by Pawel Grzybek and learned that you can't import JSON files in ES modules today. That's a real bummer because I'm pretty used to doing const data = require('./some-file.json') in Node.js.
While it will be possible to import JSON from within modules eventually, the implementation is still behind a flag (--experimental-json-modules).
This post includes ways to deal with JSON in ES modules today.
Option 1: Read and parse JSON files yourself

The Node.js documentation advises to use the fs module and do the work of reading the files and parsing it yourself.
import { readFile } from 'fs/promises';
const json = JSON.parse(
  await readFile(
    new URL('./some-file.json', import.meta.url)
  )
);

Option 2: Leverage the CommonJS require function to load JSON files

The documentation also states that you can use createRequire to load JSON files. This is the way Pawel advises in his blog post.
createRequire allows you to construct a CommonJS require function so that you can use typical CommonJS features in Node.js EcmaScript modules.
import { createRequire } from "module";
const require = createRequire(import.meta.url);
const data = require("./data.json");

How should you load JSON files?

I don't know. 🤷‍♂️ Neither option feels good, and I'll probably stick to the first option because it's more understandable.
Let's see when stable JSON modules land in Node.js!
