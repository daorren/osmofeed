😅 Two weeks ago we forgot to mention that we were taking a week off for Good Friday, so if you thought you missed an issue last Friday, don't worry.. you didn't! :-) No planned breaks until at least August now, so we're back every Friday for the foreseeable. Sorry about the confusion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Whenever you add a JavaScript click handler to DOM elements other than the good old button, you should hold on and ask yourself if you're using the correct element. Semantic HTML provides additional functionality to assistive technology and is usually more accessible than clickable div soup.
For example, buttons come with keyboard accessibility features built-in. They're focusable and can be clicked by pressing Enter or Space.
But did you know that the two keys click buttons differently?
Enter clicks a focused button on keydown
Space clicks a focused button on keyup
I found this little fun fact on Adrian's blog. Check out the post to learn more and see this click behavior in action.

Martin pointed out that the feature isn't rolled out for everybody at the time of writing this post.

Do you want them to interact with inputs while this question hangs around? Most likely not.
But how do you prevent people from doing precisely this? Covering the page with a faded-in semi-transparent div won't cut it because it's still possible to tab around and focus other areas and elements on the page using the keyboard. Folks using assistive technology might miss the dialog and navigate away, not realizing that their account is up for deletion.
The dialog element is soon cross-browser supported and can help with modal focus handling.

Twitter decided that it's reasonable to wipe out embedded Tweet content on millions of sites if the Tweet in question isn't available on their platform anymore. 😲
Kevin Marks shares this discovery in detail on his blog. Here's a quick summary for my archive.

You might have noticed I skipped last week's Web Weekly. Sitting in between moving boxes got me. Every box I unpacked just made more mess! But I'm almost done moving into my new place... 🤞
I'll also switch to scheduled sending starting next week. Web Weekly will hit your inbox around 8 AM CET every Monday from now on! 🎉
And lastly, welcome to the 54 new subscribers since the last edition! I'm super excited to have you around! 👋
And with this, today you'll learn about:
many unknown HTML tricks (there's some good stuff in this edition)
CSS layouts
messy keyboard JavaScript events
... and, as always, GitHub repositories, a new Tiny Helper and some music.
On a personal note

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a tab hoarder. There you have it! I often discover resources and keep their browser tabs open for months. They might come in handy in the future, right?
Today I'm cleaning up my browser tabs, putting things into my bookmarking system, my blog. So, here are some handy image APIs to generate random user avatars.
DiceBear avatars





          
            
DiceBear provides many hash-dependent avatars. Every URL hash (a user id or name) generates a new avatar image.
The service offers many different avatar style options, too.
And they'll get bonus points for serving SVGs! 💯
[Interactive component: visit the article to see it...]
RoboHash




          
            
RoboHash provides hash-dependent avatars, too. They're not serving SVGs but PNGs. Nevertheless, I'm super into the Futurama style!
[Interactive component: visit the article to see it...]
LOREM.SPACE





          
            
LOREM.SPACE offers more than avatar images. They provide movie and music album covers, pizzas, watches and random face pictures. It's a valuable service if you're building a shop or something!
The service doesn't generate images but redirects you to a different URL when calling their endpoints.
They receive bonus points for their built-in image resize options!
[Interactive component: visit the article to see it...]
Conclusion

I just love that we have all these random APIs available these days! 💙
I'll try to extend this post in the future. If you know of more avatar APIs, shoot them my way.

Today I learned that progress HTML elements are considered to be in an indeterminate state if you don't define a element value.

radio buttons in a group when no radio is selected
checkboxes with an indeterminate JavaScript property set true
and the mentioned progress elements without a defined value
Why's that interesting? Indeterminate elements can be selected with the :indeterminate pseudo-class. 😲 (yeah, I haven't seen that one before either).
