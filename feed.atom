Today's Web Weekly is the sixtieth edition. 😊 It's wild that this tiny newsletter has been with me for over a year now. Thanks for reading along!
This time Web Weekly includes:
a guide to networking at developer events
the security problems in the npm ecosystem
the difference between onchange and onChange
... and, as always, GitHub repositories, a new Tiny Helper and some music.
On a personal note

Today I'm entering my last week working for Contentful. It's been fabulous two years. I learned so much about management and leadership. But now, after a month-long break, I'll start my next adventure. Watch the space!
And because the situation in Europe didn't get any better. If you can, please consider offering help or donating money to the folks in Ukraine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today I learned there's a CSS property to align the last line of a rendered paragraph – text-align-last. 😲
Initially, I couldn't see the value of this property because the last paragraph line always follows the overall text-align property. If your text is left-aligned, the last line is left-aligned, too. The same applies to center and right.
So, what's the deal?
A use case for text-align-last

After researching the topic, I discovered that the property can be helpful with text-align: justify. As discussed in a Tailwind issue, you can't style justified paragraphs and control the alignment of the last line. For example, a layout like the one below is not possible without an additional CSS property.

The Go Weekly Newsletter




  





    
Go 1.18 Released
Given the extra excitement around Go 1.18 recently, it's hard to believe Go 1.17 was only released seven months ago! 1.18 is a big enough release that rather than  link solely to the main release announcement, we want to cover a variety of things you might find useful:
The official release post is a good place to start – the headline features of generics, fuzz testing, and workspaces are mentioned, but without going into details.
The official Go 1.18 release notes cover the technicalities of the release at a high level in bulletpoint fashion.

npm's rich ecosystem plays a substantial role in web development. There's a package for literally everything. And even though npm provides scoped packages these days (@stefanjudis/a-package), it's still common to release a package with a simple name.
npm is the wild wild west in this regard. Did you find a free package name? Great! Take it and do whatever you like with it.
But what's a valid package name in the first place?
Valid npm package names

Of course, npm provides an npm package to answer this question – validate-npm-package-name. Use it in your Node.js scripts to evaluate if a package name would be valid on the npm registry. The project repository also lists req…]]></summary>

Browsers would treat type annotations as inline comments and not throw runtime errors if you violate them. But why bother if things are ignored anyway?
Let's think this through: if inline type annotations would be valid JavaScript (even though browsers don't parse or run them), you could save a code compilation step.
TypeScript is not valid JavaScript so that the provided TypeScript tooling constantly transforms your code to make it runnable. File watchers compile your Typescript code to JavaScript in development on every file save. And to ship to production, your entire codebase needs to b…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A long time ago in 2014, the dialog element landed in Chromium 37. The idea behind the HTML element was to make it easier to build modals, dialogs and popups.
The specification defines the element as follows:
The dialog element represents a part of an application that a user interacts with to perform a task, for example a dialog box, inspector, or window.
We have 2022 now and almost made it to be able to use the dialog element! 🎉 In March, starting with Safari 15.4 (Safari release notes) and Firefox 98 (Firefox release notes), both missing browsers ship the element that's in Chromium for ages.
This progress brings us to a cross-browser-supported dialog element in all evergreen browsers soon!
