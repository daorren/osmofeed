        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My dotfiles are powering multiple machines, and overall I've been happy with them. They include hand-written shell scripts to create symlinks, download all desktop apps and CLI tools, and get my preferred system settings in place. But overall, they've become a Frankenstein over time because many random scripts are doing random things. And obviously, I failed to document what's going on properly.
Sure, scripts have to run to install stuff, but for config file management, most solutions I've seen seemed too complicated to keep some files in sync. And I really don't want to use a dotfile framework to pull some configuration files.
What if there is a way to tweak Git and track all the .*rc and config files?
"Dotfiles management" describes Git magic to track all files somewhere on your machine from a single .git repository. Yes, your read that right. Any file and anywhere.
alias dotfiles='git --git-dir=/home/mx/.dotfiles --work-tree=/'

That's right; there's a .git folder somewhere on your machine (/home/mx/.dotfiles in the example), and it'll track all the files no matter where they're located, thanks to the --work-tree argument. Then there's no symlink dance!
With some additional configuration, you can add and sync files across machines without scripts using dotfiles add or dotfiles commit. It's all just plain Git.
This dotfiles approach is by far the smartest I've seen, and I'll definitely give it a shot when I fiddle with my system config the next time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm continuing my journey of learning TypeScript, and it's a wild ride. Sometimes I feel like I have things under control, but other times, I'm looking at a type definition at work, and all I can do is scratch my head in confusion. It'll be a long journey!
Today I discovered a somewhat basic but very useful feature that's in TS since 3.4 (released in 2019). That's a century in web development, but hey, I'm still starting out!
How to narrow types with const assertions

Let's look at a trivial example.
const resource = {id: '123'};

if (resource.id === '234') {
  console.log('yay!');
}

If you look at it, you'll probably see that there's no way this code logs out yay! because the resource.id isn't changed to 234. But TypeScript doesn't know that, and if you inspect the resulting type, you'll find that resource.id is just a string. And that does make sense because it doesn't matter if you declare an object with the const keyword; you can still change the properties as you like.
But what if you want to treat the object as truly immutable? Turns out, you can narrow types and explicitly tell TypeScript that resource won't change with two words ‚Äî as const.
const resource = {id: '123'} as const;

if (resource.id === '234') {
  console.log('yay');
}

And voil√† ‚Äî look at this extra level of type safety! üëè
Now that TypeScript knows that resource is immutable, it narrows the property type from string to 123, and it complains if you're trying to alter the constant object. That's pretty handy for all sorts of operations!
The TypeScript docs are a quick read if you want to learn more.

Before we start, I want to thank the people supporting my tiny indie newsletter on Patreon. Since last week, I've been able to cover the cost of sending almost 3.5k emails every week. Thank you, Benjamin, Leanne, Leon, Daniel and Paul! You rock!

I do a lot of YT thumbnails these days and usually use remove.bg to remove backgrounds from pictures. But this feature is natively included in macOS these days! üò≤
macOS background removal via Quick Actions
      
    
I don't follow all the new OS features because I'm not entirely bought into the Apple universe and am very happy with all my workflows.
But removing backgrounds is a super handy feature! It's a little odd to have this functionality on an operating system level, though. What will be next? Removing background noise from audio files? Cut prepare images for social sharing? I have no clue, but I'd be game for all of these. ;)
I didn't check when this feature was added to macOS, but the video shows Ventura 13.1.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been writing JavaScript for so long that I sometimes don't see its quirks. To be fair, there are fewer quirks than ten years ago, but some things would still make great language additions. One thing that would make a lot of sense is required function parameters.
Assume you have a function that defines required arguments. And you really really want to make sure the function is called with the correct arguments by throwing an error.
Here's what you might do:
function doSomethingWithAThing(theThing) {
  if (typeof theThing === "undefined") {
    throw new Error("theThing is required");
  }
}

That's quite a bit of code for such a simple thing.
Unfortunately, you can't do something like this in JavaScript ...
function doSomethingWithAThing(
  theThing = throw new Error("theThing Is Undefined")
) {
  // ...
}

... because JavaScript doesn't like it.
Peter Kr√∂ner published a handy snippet that he carries around from project to project. The post is in German, so here's the English gist of it.
First, define a fail function.
function fail(reason, ErrorConstructor = Error) {
  throw new ErrorConstructor(reason);
}

And second... use it. ü´£
By restructuring the code and transforming the error throwing portion into an expression, you can immediately throw in case a function is called without the required parameters.
function doSomethingWithAThing(
  theThing = fail('theThing Is Undefined')
) {
  // ...
}

What a beautiful sort of one-line workaround.
Thanks Peter!

Do you know that you can use CSS Grid to animate an element's height? Have you heard of the new scrollend JavaScript event? Or do you use rel="tag" somewhere?
All the answers and much more are included in this week's Web Weekly. ü´£
Regarding forms, you should rely on the native form elements because they provide the best user experience, right?
I remember being overly excited when Safari finally started supporting date inputs two years ago.
But are these native elements really always the best choice?
Robin Thomas shared multiple reasons why the iOS date picker sucks. And I can relate ‚Äî filling in a date on mobile sometimes feels like this CodePen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Did you ever curse the JSON data format for not allowing comments and wondered what the heck? Yeah, same here.
Surprisingly, JSON, in its initial spec, did allow comments, but comment support was removed for three reasons:
People put parsing instructions into comments breaking portability across platforms and languages.
Comments introduced complexity that might not be needed for a data format.
The JSON creators wanted it to be compatible with early YAML versions.
It's a bummer because JSON outgrew its serial data use case, and it's widespread to have JSON config files these days. :/
Pawel Grzybek pointed out that the lack of comments and other features led to the JSON5 spec, which aimed to be a JSON extension suitable for config files and was adopted by VS Code and many other software products today.
If you want to learn more, here's why comments were removed on YouTube.

The only solution was to tweak random Codepens, and I spent a good half an hour creating vertical and horizontal lines in CSS.
