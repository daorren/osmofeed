You might have noticed that I took a two-week break from Web Weekly. I just felt too exhausted with too many moving pieces in my life. But everything's on track again! 😊
I started building a proper landing page for this newsletter mainly to play around with Remix. It felt great that I didn't hit any blockers and could get rolling right away. The structure of Remix files reminds me of writing PHP back in the day, though. Is this web development repeating itself with another file extension?
I have a quick ask: do you see the testimonials section? I'd love to include more quotes in it. If you enjoy Web Weekly, it'd be great if you could share it online. Thank you!

Tim Bray's Go Diaries: Generics — Tim (one of the original co-authors of the XML spec) finds a use case for generics in his Quamima pattern matching library, only to find that there are some ‘bumps in the road’ which he shares here for everyone’s benefit.
Tim concludes: “I don’t hate Go’s generics, which is actually pretty strong testimony given that I spent the best part of a couple of days fighting all the stuff described above. But, my guess is the Go generics story is isn’t finished yet.”

Jim explains why browsers should expose site-specific color scheme preference controls. Imagine you could run your operating system in dark mode (I really like the dark MacOS UI!), your browser in light mode, and still switch particular sites to dark mode.
I'm super into this idea! Read Jim's post if you want to learn more about this color preference cascade. ☝️
The post includes a few things that stand out, though.

Whenever you find yourself cd'ing around in a large project just to reach the root of a git repository, the following alias might come in handy.
alias gr='cd $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)'

It automatically navigates you to the git repo root! 💪

TIL there's a `headers` HTML attribute that you can to make cells spanning across columns more accessible. 😲

I rarely use tables because I usually don't deal with tabular data. But suppose you're building complex tables with cells spanning multiple columns or rows. In that case, you can use headers to define which table header elements are connected to the particular table cell.
Here are some resources to read more about it:

You might know that you can disable pinch-to-zoom on mobile devices using an evil meta element.

But did you know that you can overwrite this meta element and force Chrome and Firefox to allow pinch-to-zoom?
Now you do. 😉
