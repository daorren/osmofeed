        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As far as I see, it's time to ditch hsl() and use oklch() for color palettes and design systems. Why's that?
For me, it boils down to two reasons.
New devices and monitors can display colors that aren't defined in the sRGB color space used by rgb(), hsl() or hex colors. Isn't it sad that you can't express these vibrant colors in CSS using existing color methods?
It is. And the solution are new CSS color functions that can talk new and fancy monitor tech (namely wide-gamut P3 colors). It's party time y'all — the web gets a color update with fresh and vibrant colors.
There's oklch(), oklab() and also color() to target the wider color space, but let's focus on oklch() because it's the most user-friendly.
oklch()'s parameters (lightness, chroma and hue) are easy to grasp and feel very similar …]]></summary>

How does Google do site reliability engineering? Is using relative CSS units (rem) to control spaces like margins and paddings a good idea? Are you ready to adopt native and relaxed CSS nesting?

I heard having your own font is important for successful tech companies these days. Vercel followed the playbook and released Geist.
Shortly after, GitHub followed. But the Octocat maintainers didn't release yet another standard coding font, but rather an entire font family — say hello to "Monaspace".
Monaspace is a set of five variable fonts supporting the same font axes. I haven't tried it yet, but theoretically, you could mix and match the fonts, and they'll stay on the same grid. Sweet!

With macOS Sonoma, it's possible to "install" web pages as Safari web apps with the new "add to dock" feature.
I use Chrome (for work) and Firefox (for private), so why would I care? I use Gmail, Google Calendar and Twitter as standalone Chrome apps to get them out of my tab bar. But they have some annoyances.
I gave "add to dock" a spin, and I'll stick to it. Here's why:
I can spin up an installed web app without kicking off the base browser. If I install a Safari web app, it's its own thing. It has its own cookies, history and can be opened independently. It always bugged me that…]]></summary>

I'm no big GitHub mobile user, but occasionally, I browse projects while on the go. With the fat finger problem, navigating complex sites can be a pain. And the same goes for GitHub. The account owner and repository home link are super close to each other in the header. Just by looking at them, every mobile user knows that hitting the right target requires surgical tap precision.
What does GitHub do about these tiny and too-close-to-each-other links? Change the design? Obviously not. They change the UI functionality entirely and put the account owner and repository into a button.
The button then opens a modal that asks where you want to go. Smart.
What's a good target size, though?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[JavaScript is always good for a surprise, isn't it?
Nicholas C. Zakas published a discovery that made my head spin. Do you know the array method every?
This is how MDN describes what it does:
The every() method of Array instances tests whether all elements in the array pass the test implemented by the provided function. It returns a Boolean value.
Cool, that makes sense.
const collection = ['great', 'nope', 'great'];
const allItemsAreGreat = collection.every((item) => item === 'great'); // false

But now, see what happens when you use every with an empty array.
[].every((item) => item === 'great'); // true
[].every((item) => item !== 'great'); // true

Whoops?! I didn't expect that every() will tell me that every item matches my condition if there are none. That's not how my brain works.
When using the array method, you have to flip around your mindset. Here's Nicholas:
I’d suggest changing the way you read every() calls when you come across them. Instead of reading every() as “does every item in this array match this condition?” read it as, “is there any item in this array that doesn’t match this condition?”.
And it gets every weirder. Check the results for an empty array with some().
[].some((item) => item === 'great'); // false
[].some((item) => item !== 'great'); // false

Oh boy... Why do the array methods behave that way? The answer is Math, and if you want to dive deeper, check Nicholas' post. 💯
