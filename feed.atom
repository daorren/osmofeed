        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How often do you set margin on absolute positioned elements? I rarely do it and might even say I've never done it. I mean, the whole point of absolute positioning is to place an element in its container. What's there to margin?
But while reading Josh Comeau's guide on div centering, I learned a CSS trick that I will remember.
Let's say you want to center a modal — how do you do it?
For years, I moved the element to the middle and then moved it back by its half width and height. Et voilà!
.box {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  translate: -50% -50%;
}

While this approach works, it always felt clunky. An alternative is not to rely on absolute positioning with flexbox or grid. And that's fair, but what if we still want to center with position: absolute?
Josh taught me a nifty magic trick. Check this out. 👇
[Interactive component: visit the article to see it...]
Magic!
But what's going on here? If I read the Positioned Layout spec correctly, here's what's happening:
The size of an absolute positioned element is calculated via its "inset" properties (top, left, inset, ...). The resulting box is then called inset-modified containing block.
A defined preferred size (via width and height) can then limit an element's size inside this containing block. This result is called the used size.
A defined maximum size (via max-width and max-height) can then overwrite the preferred size, again changing the used size.
And here's the catch: if we now have a containing block defined via inset properties, but the element's used size is not filling it out. Then margin: auto comes into play and distributes the available space on each axis.
Holy moly!
Thanks, Josh; I'll add this trick to my toolbox!

:root {
  --width: 20em;
}

/* this doesn't work :/ */
@media (min-width: var(--width)) {
}

I discovered the solution to this problem a while ago — custom media queries.
/* this isn't supported anywhere */
@custom-media --narrow-window (max-width: 30em);

@media (--narrow-window) {
  /* narrow window styles */
}

Unfortunately, as far as I know, custom media queries have never been implemented anywhere. Bummer.
However, the CSS evolution is still in full swing, and we have CSS features we couldn't even dream of years ago. :has(), native CSS nesting and container queries are ready to use.
With container queries, custom property style queries are slowly becoming a thing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here's a quick tip from the excellent vscode.email newsletter: VS Code allows you to mark files as readonly.
When would you use it?
Many applications include generated files, which could be data models or schemas. These files are often checked into version control and only updated periodically. People know they shouldn't touch these files because they start with a big warning — do not edit this file manually.
Here's a file from my current project.
/**
 * ...
 *
 * NOTE: This class is auto generated by OpenAPI Generator (https://openapi-generator.tech).
 * https://openapi-generator.tech
 * Do not edit the class manually.
 */

Do people read all the comments? No. Does this prevent me from changing the file manually? Also, no.
I love the idea of solving this problem at the editor level.
The "Readonly include" option accepts files or glob patterns.
And voila! I can't edit these generated files in VS Code anymore now.
The trick is not to define this setting in your global config but rather in your workspace or project config at your-project/.vscode/settings.json.
{
  "files.readonlyInclude": {
    "src/app/core/generated-models/**": true
  }
}

Now, no VS Code user will edit the generated files. Win win!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have the constant urge to "do stuff". My to-do and idea lists are endless collections of things I'd love to do one day. But there's a problem — my side hustle schedule is pretty busy already.
I want to keep this blog active. I run a weekly web development newsletter. I maintain some open-source projects. I collect online tools.
These projects alone eat a good chunk of my free time, and while I love doing them, they add up. There are only so many hours in the day.
For years, I ran the @randomMDN Twitter bot. Then Elmo broke the Twitter APIs. I was puzzled. "This is one of my projects; it can't just be over, can it?" buzzed in my head. I've had a hard time letting go, I guess.
Fast forward. I hadn't had time to fix or deal with the problem, and it was over. Just like that, one of my projects dropped off the list.
Lovely people ported Random MDN to the Fediverse if you want random web dev facts in your feed.
I realized I treat most projects as "forever projects".
Of course, I work on this project every week. Of course, I'll answer these GitHub issues over the weekend. Of course, I keep this online resource up-to-date. And, of course, this isn't a sustainable.
As Jamie Wilkinson puts it, he doesn't want to do forever projects anymore. Everything has a shelf life. Kicking things off is great, but letting things go is as important.
Treat beginnings like endings: celebrate them, document them.
It's simple: to have time for new projects and passions, one has to let go.
By ending well, you give yourself the freedom to begin again.
Great advice.
