        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes, I'm surprised about how smart TypeScript is. Let's assume you want to type your app's release version numbers. The format is [releaseMonth]-[releaseYear]. There won't be a new version every month or year.
How hard is it to define a type for this? It's not hard at all.
js

// define release years
type releaseYear = '2022' | '2023' | '2024';
// define release months
type releasteMonth = '03' | '07' | '11';
// combine the two types in a template literal type
type versionNumber = `${releasteMonth}.${releaseYear}`;
Â 
const version: versionNumber = '04.2022';
Type '"04.2022"' is not assignable to type '"03.2022" | "03.2023" | "03.2024" | "07.2022" | "07.2023" | "07.2024" | "11.2022" | "11.2023" | "11.2024"'. Did you mean '"03.2022"'?2820Type '"04.2022"' is not assignable to type '"03.2022" | "03.2023" | "03.2024" | "07.2022" | "07.2023" | "07.2024" | "11.2022" | "11.2023" | "11.2024"'. Did you mean '"03.2022"'?

For these situations, TypeScript defines Template Literal Types based on good old template strings. Sweet!

Ignoring the question of when you would want to turn off automatic password filling, how hard can it be to tell browsers and password managers not to mess with an input field?
As Flavio shared, 1Password relies on data-1p-ignore. Fair enough. This attribute is oddly specific, though.
How can you turn off auto-completion for LastPass users, then? That's right! Add data-lpignore="true" to your input field.
But I'm a happy Dashlane user; how about this one? Dashlane created an entire spec called Semantically Annotated Web Forms to handle form completion. An easy data-form-type="other" will do it for this password manager.

The chapter is split into two blog posts:
Accessible notifications with ARIA Live Regions (Part 1)
Accessible notifications with ARIA Live Regions (Part 2)
I strongly suggest you read these, but disclaimer: you'll need a while to make yourself through them.
For my archive, here are some rough notes from reading the chapter.
Live region roles vs. the aria-live attribute

To define an element as a live region, you can use the aria-live attribute or go with a live region role (alert, status, log, marquee or timer). From all these roles, alert and status are fair game because they're well supported.
Regions have one advantage over the aria-live attribute.
Another advantage toâ€¦]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's look at what happens when I google myself.
Of course, I know how my site is structured, and I can tell that Google displays my site's title and the description includes some of the root page's headlines. The description is not the worst, but it certainly could be better.
Is there a way to exclude elements from being shown in the Google snippet?
Today I learned that there is! And the solution is based on an HTML data attribute: data-nosnippet. Here's the example snippet from the Google Search Central docs:
<p>This text can be shown in a snippet
<span data-nosnippet>and this part would not be shown</span>.</p>

<div data-nosnippet>not in snippet</div>
<div data-nosnippet="true">also not in snippet</div>
<div data-nosnippet="false">also not in snippet</div>

data-nosnippet works on div, span and section elements, and it doesn't care what value you'll give it. data-nosnippet="true" and data-nosnippet="false" have the same result â€” signaling that this element shouldn't pop up in the Google Search results. Nice!
If you're unhappy with the search results, add some juicy data attributes now. But remember to trigger a reindex in the Search Console. Otherwise, it might take a while until your changes have an effect.
