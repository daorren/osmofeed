Unfortunately, console prototyping can sometimes be a little cumbersome for extensive snippets because the console isn't built for writing extended snippets spanning multiple lines. You can work around this by pressing Shift + Enter, but still, it's not great.
Today, I was thrilled to learn that the Firefox developer tools provide a somewhat hidden multi-line console editor to write extended snippets more easily!
This feature is top DX in action! 💯 Thanks Firefox.

As you may know, I started a new job recently and had to set up a new Gmail account. I discovered that there are some customizations I can't live without. Maybe they're valuable for you, too!
My morning routine includes getting my inbox as close to zero as possible. To not get distracted, I turn on auto-advance. Find the feature under the "Advanced" settings and automatically move to the next email after replying, deleting or archiving an email. It's perfect for flying through your inbox while keeping the flow!
Keyboard shortcuts are hidden behind the "Advanced" settings, too. Once you have enabled it, you can navigate your inbox using your keyboard! 💯

Trending Tweets often come with priceless comments. And it turned out that there are multiple ways to control the numbers of an ordered list.
Let's have a quick look!
Specify the list start using start

Manuel pointed out that the start attribute also allows you to specify the beginning of the unordered list. Ordered lists usually start at 1.
[Interactive component: visit the article to see it...]
This functionality is valuable if your listings are divided by paragraphs and additional information.
Define the list item position using value

As already mentioned; if you want to control the position of a single list item, you can also use the value attribute on a specific list item.
[Interactive component: visit the article to see it...]
This functionality is valuable if you're dealing with rankings and two entries are in the same position.
Bonus: Control list styles via CSS

And for completeness, there are also ways to control the list styles via list-style in CSS.
[Interactive component: visit the article to see it...]
Read more about list-style on MDN.
If you're going for custom list styles, don't visually change the meaning of your listing to keep your HTML accessible in RSS feeds or assistive technology.

It's so fascinating that HTML still holds surprises for me after writing it for over ten years!

I have a quick ask: do you see the testimonials section? I'd love to include more quotes in it. If you enjoy Web Weekly, it'd be great if you could share it online. Thank you!

Tim Bray's Go Diaries: Generics — Tim (one of the original co-authors of the XML spec) finds a use case for generics in his Quamima pattern matching library, only to find that there are some ‘bumps in the road’ which he shares here for everyone’s benefit.
Tim concludes: “I don’t hate Go’s generics, which is actually pretty strong testimony given that I spent the best part of a couple of days fighting all the stuff described above. But, my guess is the Go generics story is isn’t finished yet.”

Jim explains why browsers should expose site-specific color scheme preference controls. Imagine you could run your operating system in dark mode (I really like the dark MacOS UI!), your browser in light mode, and still switch particular sites to dark mode.
I'm super into this idea! Read Jim's post if you want to learn more about this color preference cascade. ☝️
