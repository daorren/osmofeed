If you're using Gmail and Chrome, privacy's a lost cause anyways, but let's not get into this topic.
Now, even though I use Gmail, I prefer to sign in with Email/Password combinations and let my password manager do its magic. And with this setup, I don't need yet another modal begging for attention. 👇
Thanks to Ricky Mondello, today I learned you can disable Google's Sign-In nudges in your account settings!
Thank goodness — less pop-ups are more fun!
