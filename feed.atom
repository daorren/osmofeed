        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes, I'm surprised about how smart TypeScript is. Let's assume you want to type your app's release version numbers. The format is [releaseMonth]-[releaseYear]. There won't be a new version every month or year.
How hard is it to define a type for this? It's not hard at all.
js

// define release years
type releaseYear = '2022' | '2023' | '2024';
// define release months
type releasteMonth = '03' | '07' | '11';
// combine the two types in a template literal type
type versionNumber = `${releasteMonth}.${releaseYear}`;
Â 
const version: versionNumber = '04.2022';
Type '"04.2022"' is not assignable to type '"03.2022" | "03.2023" | "03.2024" | "07.2022" | "07.2023" | "07.2024" | "11.2022" | "11.2023" | "11.2024"'. Did you mean '"03.2022"'?2820Type '"04.2022"' is not assignable to type '"03.2022" | "03.2023" | "03.2024" | "07.2022" | "07.2023" | "07.2024" | "11.2022" | "11.2023" | "11.2024"'. Did you mean '"03.2022"'?

For these situations, TypeScript defines Template Literal Types based on good old template strings. Sweet!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Flavio shared how to tell 1Password not to interact with an input element.
Ignoring the question of when you would want to turn off automatic password filling, how hard can it be to tell browsers and password managers not to mess with an input field?
As Flavio shared, 1Password relies on data-1p-ignore. Fair enough. This attribute is oddly specific, though.
How can you turn off auto-completion for LastPass users, then? That's right! Add data-lpignore="true" to your input field.
But I'm a happy Dashlane user; how about this one? Dashlane created an entire spec called Semantically Annotated Web Forms to handle form completion. An easy data-form-type="other" will do it for this password manager.
