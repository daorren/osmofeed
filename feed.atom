I usually try to ignore all this AI/ML stuff, but we're entering spooky times, and I decided it's better to be informed about what's happening.
DALL·E is a fun example, right? Give the algorithm a random sentence and receive generated images. It's not perfect yet, but good enough to tweet some funny pictures.
And it's also cool that you can feed computers an image like the "Girl with a Pearl Earring", and they just extend it.
Or pair rough sketches with a description to generate art. (This one's wild. 👇)
There's rapid development in all this, and it's scary. Because where will we draw the line?
Computers are becoming so good at painting, writing and creating that we'll always have to investigate if a human or an algorithm made something. Do we have to become exp…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's speedy TIL time! Did you know the loading="lazy" attribute doesn't work when you turn off JavaScript?
Now, you do. 😉
Why doesn't lazy load work without JS? There's only one reason why we can't have nice things: of course, it's for tracking prevention.
Here's the loading MDN documentation explaining the behavior:
Loading is only deferred when JavaScript is enabled. This is an anti-tracking measure, because if a user agent supported lazy loading when scripting is disabled, it would still be possible for a site to track a user's approximate scroll position throughout a session, by strategically placing images in a page's markup such that a server can track how many images are requested and when.
And if you really want to get into this topic, here's the related spec describing when loading="lazy" should work.
And just to be clear, because some folks were confused: images will still load when JS is disabled. It's only the deferred loading that won't work.

Let's talk about a never-ending programming argument: TABS vs. SPACES. I know, I know... but hear me out! 😉
I don't care too much about it because wrangling code into whatever coding convention is an editor's job. Prettier for the win!
But I've always been in "the space camp" for my projects. It's my code, and I make the rules, right?
This week I took a big step, moved camps and changed my first repo to be tabs-first!
So, what changed my opinion?
The Prettier maintainers consider moving to tabs with their next major release because it saves bytes and is more flexible. Let's dive into these points.
I converted all JS files (including all node_modules) of my blog's code base to tabs and saved a whooping 11MB on my hard drive. So, this is a weak argument at best.
But off …]]></summary>

I applied this change to this blog's repository, and a problem came to light. If you change the formatting of hundreds of files, you're messing with your Git history. git blame becomes pretty useless. Thousands of lines will be marked with an unimportant formatting change.
I started googling around to find out how to ignore commits in Git and VS code...
Ignore commits via --ignore-rev

If you use git blame on the command line, the --ignore-rev option lets you blame a file without considering this nasty formatting commit.
git blame --ignore-rev a926bba49c index.js

This is great but didn't help me because I rarely use git blame on the command line, and even if I would, I wouldn't want to always think …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today I learned about an alternative syntax to force push git branches.
git push --force origin main
git push -f origin main
git push origin +main

One hand the + saves some characters and somehow feels less scary to me, but on the other hand is force pushing only a single character typo away. That's scary!
Force pushing is dangerous. If you collaborate with others on a project, consider using the --force-with-lease flag instead.
