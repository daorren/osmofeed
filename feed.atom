You may have noticed that I took a break from Web Weekly. I didn't feel like writing it and spent more time watching the news. Wherever you are, take care of yourself, rest and consider helping the people in the Ukraine.
This time Web Weekly includes:
resources to help the Ukraine
type checking of JavaScript files
the new dialog element
... and, as always, GitHub repositories, a new Tiny Helper and some music.
On a personal note

I just couldn't believe it because we're still in the pandemic, but we face a war in Europe. It's horrifying to see cities I've been to a few years ago being bombed and attacked. People leave their lives behind and are fleeing as we speak.

You might know that I'm always on the hunt for editor workflows that help me save some keystrokes. Check the "JavaScript booster" extension if you're looking for VS Code commands to convert let to const, replace strings with template strings or convert arrow functions to anonymous functions. It's so good!

      
        
        
          
        
        
      
      
The new command – "Surround with snippet"

The functionality is quickly explained. Highlight the code lines you want to surround with a snippet, open the command palette and wrap away!
Here's it in action. 👇

Following the proposal, the following JavaScript lines would be valid.
function add(a: number, b: number) {
    return a + b;
}

Browsers would treat type annotations as inline comments and not throw runtime errors if you violate them. But why bother if things are ignored anyway?
Let's think this through: if inline type annotations would be valid JavaScript (even though browsers don't parse or run them), you could save a code compilation step.
TypeScript is not valid JavaScript so that the provided TypeScript tooling constantly transforms your code to make it runnable. File watchers compile your Typescript code to JavaScript in development on every file save. And to ship to production, your entire codebase needs to b…]]></summary>

The specification defines the element as follows:
The dialog element represents a part of an application that a user interacts with to perform a task, for example a dialog box, inspector, or window.
We have 2022 now and almost made it to be able to use the dialog element! 🎉 In March, starting with Safari 15.4 (Safari release notes) and Firefox 98 (Firefox release notes), both missing browsers ship the element that's in Chromium for ages.
This progress brings us to a cross-browser-supported dialog element in all evergreen browsers soon!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chris Ferdinandi, the vanilla JavaScript guy, published an excellent coding tip to make your JavaScript conditions more readable.
Suppose you have the following condition:
if (fruit === 'apple' || fruit === 'strawberry') {
  // ...
}

My mind needs a moment to process this if. It's just not easy to read. And additionally, the condition becomes even harder to read if there are more fruits and you have to chain all these logical ORs.
And now look at what Chris advises to use instead:
if (['apple', 'strawberry'].includes(fruit)) {
  // ...
}

// or even place things in a variable 
// to make it even clearer
if (deliciousFruits.includes(fruit)) {
  // ...
}

Is that readable code, or what? 😲 The condition even includes the word includes to make it easier to understand! 👏 It's a tiny change that improves readability tremendously.
I'll adopt this pattern from now on! Thanks, Chris.

        <link href="https://www.stefanjudis.com/today-i-learned/the-array-prototype-reduces-initial-value-is-optional/"/>
        <updated>2022-02-18T23:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[reduce() is one of these underrated Array methods that can be tremendously useful to accumulate array items. Define an initial value, iterate over all array items and define a callback function to form a combined result.
The beauty: each callback's return value is provided to the next entry callback so that you can sum numbers or regroup the array entries inside of an object.
reduce((previousValue, currentValue) => {
  /* ... */
});
reduce((previousValue, currentValue, currentIndex) => {
  /* ... */
});
reduce((previousValue, currentValue, currentIndex, array) => {
  /* ... */
});
reduce((previousValue, currentValue, currentIndex, array) => {
  /* ... */
}, initialValue);

And after all these years, looking at these recude callback signatures, I discovered that the initial value is optional. 😲
Let's look at an example of summing numbers.
// sum all numbers in the array
// start with `0`
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].reduce((previousValue, currentValue) => {
  console.log(previousValue);
  // the return value will be the next `previousValue`
  return previousValue + currentValue;
}, 0); // 15

// Output in the console:
// 0 
// 1 
// 3
// 6
// 10 
// 15

You might ask if the first iteration starting with 0 is necessary. And you're correct – it's redundant and is a case for not providing an initial value at all!
// sum all numbers in the array
// start with `1`
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].reduce((previousValue, currentValue) => {
  console.log(previousValue);
  // the return value will be the next `previousValue`
  return previousValue + currentValue;
}); // 15

// Output in the console:
// 1 
// 3
// 6
// 10 
// 15

Without a second argument, the reduce loop starts with the first array entry instead of an initial value – ergo, you'll save one iteration! 🎉
This is a nifty little find! Big thanks to Ramón, who tweeted this tip!
If you want to learn more about the array method, head over to the reduce entry on MDN.
