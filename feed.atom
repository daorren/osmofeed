Let's Discuss Backward Compatibility in Go — When Russ Cox starts a discussion, we listen. Rather than focus on a new feature, he reflects on Go 1’s compatibility promise (that you’ll be able to compile older Go programs on future versions) and areas where it fails or falls short. It's dry, but important stuff to understand, particularly if you need to maintain Go projects over time.

Concurrency Isn’t Always Faster in Go — The author of 100 Go Mistakes and How to Avoid Them digs into mistake 56 (of the 100!) with a look at the assumption that doing something concurrently must be faster than sequentially. Unsurprisingly, it’s complicated..

But, at the time, the :focus pseudo-class was the only thing we had, and removing focus outlines entirely would break keyboard accessibility. So we had to push back and fight for proper focus outlines!
Luckily, the :focus-visible pseudo-class helped out. Using :focus-visible, you could only show outlines when a person navigated links and buttons via the keyboard. Win-win! 💪
But then, a tricky transition period started. How should we work around browsers that don't support the pseudo-class yet? There are two ways.

I usually try to ignore all this AI/ML stuff, but we're entering spooky times, and I decided it's better to be informed about what's happening.
DALL·E is a fun example, right? Give the algorithm a random sentence and receive generated images. It's not perfect yet, but good enough to tweet some funny pictures.
And it's also cool that you can feed computers an image like the "Girl with a Pearl Earring", and they just extend it.
Or pair rough sketches with a description to generate art. (This one's wild. 👇)
There's rapid development in all this, and it's scary. Because where will we draw the line?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's speedy TIL time! Did you know the loading="lazy" attribute doesn't work when you turn off JavaScript?
Now, you do. 😉
Why doesn't lazy load work without JS? There's only one reason why we can't have nice things: of course, it's for tracking prevention.
Here's the loading MDN documentation explaining the behavior:
Loading is only deferred when JavaScript is enabled. This is an anti-tracking measure, because if a user agent supported lazy loading when scripting is disabled, it would still be possible for a site to track a user's approximate scroll position throughout a session, by strategically placing images in a page's markup such that a server can track how many images are requested and when.
And if you really want to get into this topic, here's the related spec describing when loading="lazy" should work.
And just to be clear, because some folks were confused: images will still load when JS is disabled. It's only the deferred loading that won't work.
