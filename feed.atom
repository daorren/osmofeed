        <link href="https://www.stefanjudis.com/today-i-learned/how-to-safely-remove-untracked-files-from-git-repos/"/>
        <updated>2023-03-03T23:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The great thing about Git is that almost all actions are reversible! But there's one command that isn't, and it can cause real headaches — git clean.
# remove all untracked files
git clean .

The clean command removes untracked files from your Git working tree, and while that's sometimes exactly what you want, you should really run the command with caution.
You're probably frustrated when you want to start over, but you should be sure you want to throw away everything. Some files might still be valuable. If you run git clean, they're gone — end of story.
By default, Git will not allow you to clean up a repository unless you have clean.requireForce set to false. But you know how it is: an innocent -f is quickly added.
I learned today that git clean (and other commands) support a --dry-run option.
git clean --dry-run .
Would remove not-important.js
Would remove untracked-but-very-important.js

If you want a shorter command line option, use the very intuitive (not!) -n argument.
git clean -n .
Would remove not-important.js
Would remove untracked-but-very-important.js

The command prints out what it would remove without doing any damage. Handy! It also comes with a useful interactive mode to handle many untracked files.
git clean -i
Would remove the following items:
  not-important.js   untracked-but-very-important.js
  
*** Commands ***
  1: clean   2: filter by pattern   3: select by numbers   4: ask each   5: quit   6: help
What now> 4
Remove not-important.js [y/N]? y
Remove untracked-but-very-important.js [y/N]? N
Removing not-important.js

You can choose between pattern matching or checking each file one by one in the interactive mode. Nice one, Git! 💪
But what about other Git commands? Most of the other dry runs don't seem very exciting to me because, as said, most of the Git operations are reversible. But one that I could see come in handy is a git remote prune dry run to avoid removing remote branches. But that's about it. 🤷‍♂️

Opting In to Transparent Telemetry in Go — A debate around adding telemetry to the Go toolchain has been rolling for the past few weeks. Now there’s a new development: “By far the most common suggestion was to make the system opt-in (default off) instead of opt-out (default on). I have revised the design to do that.” There are some downsides to that, of course.

When will :has() and @container be ready-to-use? What's behind /.well-known URIs? How can you style the ugly file input button?
All the answers and much more are included in this week's Web Weekly. 😊
Last week started with a real banger: container size queries (@container) landed in Firefox on valentines day. What a nice surprise: we love you, too, Mozilla. ♥️
All three main engines support container queries now. Unfortunately, it might take a while until Samsung Internet catches up because their Chromium updates are always behind. But hey — very soon, the new era of CSS components begins!
But what about the other huge platform feature that will change how we build for the web — :has()? Well... We don't know when the :has() pseudo-class will be ready. Firefox ships it behin…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yoav Kadosh shared a very useGlobalState React hook.
const store = {};
const listeners = {};

function useGlobalState(key, initialValue) {
  const [state, _setState] = useState(store[key] || initialValue);
  const setState = useCallback((stateOrSetter) => {
    let next = stateOrSetter;
    if (typeof stateOrSetter === "function") {
      next = stateOrSetter(store[key]);
    }

    listeners[key].forEach((l) => l(next));
    store[key] = next;
  }, []);
  useEffect(() => {
    // Store the initial state on the first call with this key
    if (!store[key]) {
      store[key] = initialValue;
    }
    // Create an empty array of listener on the first call with this key
    if (!listeners[key]) {
      listeners[key] = [];
    }
    // Register the observer
    const listener = (state) => _setState(state);
    listeners[key].push(listener);
    // Cleanup when unmounting
    return () => {
      const index = listeners[key].indexOf(listener);
      listeners[key].splice(index, 1);
    };
  }, []);
  return [state, setState];
}

You can then use the defined useGlobalState hook to share or update application state across components. 💪
const [state, setState] = useGlobalState('someUniqueKey', INITIAL_STATE);

Are there downsides to this pattern? I don't know, and I'm a little puzzled why I haven't seen this userland hook before, but if you think useGlobalState is a bad idea, let me know!
If you want to learn more, Yoav explains how it works on his blog!

Purego: A Dynamic Way to Call C Functions from Go Without Cgo — No C means you can build for other platforms easily without a target C compiler/toolchain. No wrapper functions either. One of the contributors noted on HN: "It uses the same mechanisms that Cgo does to switch to the system stack and then call the C code. Purego just avoids having to need a C toolchain to cross compile code that calls into C from Go."

Do you know that the new media query range syntax is almost cross-browser supported? Or that client-side navigation has hard-to-ignore accessibility impacts? Or that native CSS nesting shipped in Safari?
All the answers and much more are included in this week's Web Weekly. 🫣
One of the Arc browser's features is "Boosts" which allow you to inject custom CSS and JavaScript into sites. The idea is not new, but the feature is built into the browser.
BTW: I still have five Arc invites hit reply if you want to try it.
I always wonder if people really change sites because the chances are high that things break with a site update. Is that worth it?
Apparently, many people tweak the web to their liking.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My dotfiles are powering multiple machines, and overall I've been happy with them. They include hand-written shell scripts to create symlinks, download all desktop apps and CLI tools, and get my preferred system settings in place. But overall, they've become a Frankenstein over time because many random scripts are doing random things. And obviously, I failed to document what's going on properly.
Sure, scripts have to run to install stuff, but for config file management, most solutions I've seen seemed too complicated to keep some files in sync. And I really don't want to use a dotfile framework to pull some configuration files.
What if there is a way to tweak Git and track all the .*rc and config files?
"Dotfiles management" describes Git magic to track all files somewhere on your machine from a single .git repository. Yes, your read that right. Any file and anywhere.
alias dotfiles='git --git-dir=/home/mx/.dotfiles --work-tree=/'

That's right; there's a .git folder somewhere on your machine (/home/mx/.dotfiles in the example), and it'll track all the files no matter where they're located, thanks to the --work-tree argument. Then there's no symlink dance!
With some additional configuration, you can add and sync files across machines without scripts using dotfiles add or dotfiles commit. It's all just plain Git.
This dotfiles approach is by far the smartest I've seen, and I'll definitely give it a shot when I fiddle with my system config the next time.

Today I discovered a somewhat basic but very useful feature that's in TS since 3.4 (released in 2019). That's a century in web development, but hey, I'm still starting out!
How to narrow types with const assertions

Let's look at a trivial example.
const resource = {id: '123'};

if (resource.id === '234') {
  console.log('yay!');
}

If you look at it, you'll probably see that there's no way this code logs out yay! because the resource.id isn't changed to 234. But TypeScript doesn't know that, and if you inspect the resulting type, you'll find that resource.id is just a string. And that does make sense because it doesn't matter if you declare an object with the const keyword; you can still change the properties as you like.
But what if you want to treat the object as truly immutable? Turns out, you can narrow types and explicitly tell TypeScript that resource won't change with two words — as const.
const resource = {id: '123'} as const;

if (resource.id === '234') {
  console.log('yay');
}

And voilà — look at this extra level of type safety! 👏
Now that TypeScript knows that resource is immutable, it narrows the property type from string to 123, and it complains if you're trying to alter the constant object. That's pretty handy for all sorts of operations!
The TypeScript docs are a quick read if you want to learn more.

An Introduction to Go's Profile-Guided Optimization — What if the Go compiler could improve how it compiles software based upon real-world profiling? Profile-Guided Optimization (PGO) feeds runtime profiles to the compiler to optimize the binary based on usage.
