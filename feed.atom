✍️ If you're intrigued about domain-driven design (DDD), we've got an interview with Matt Boyle, the author of Domain-Driven Design with Go – it's at the end of today's issue.

An Update on Go Toolchains — Russ Cox noted that “many people believe the go line in the go.mod file specifies which Go toolchain to use.” Not so.. but from Go 1.21 the go command will use its own bundled toolchain if that toolchain is at least as new as the go or toolchain lines in the module/workspace. If the toolchain is outdated, the newer version will be obtained. The official docs have been significantly extended to explain the situation.

A ::selection compatibility issue

Here is the bug in question in all its glory.
Twitter Tweet box not showing selection styles in Chrome.
      
    
Suppose you're writing a Tweet or DM in the Twitter UI using Chrome; the text selection is invisible. That's a pretty bad UX and an accessibility issue.
Moritz Gießmann pointed out that this bug can be fixed by turning off Chrome's experimental web features. And indeed, it makes all browsers behave the same. I'm beyond confused and will update the post later. 😅

Do you want to know why the new .zip domains are a security thread? Or what the passwordrules HTML attribute is about? Or want to see some stunning view transition examples?
All the answers and much more are included in this week's Web Weekly. 🫣
Let's kick things off with some web platform updates!
Firefox 113 was released this month, and with it, two major web features went into cross-browser territory.
First, the :nth-child() pseudo-class got an upgrade and now supports the fancy pany of syntax.
The new syntax is on my long list to blog about, but until I get to it, Bramus has you covered on web.dev.
And second, new colorspaces and CSS functions are entering the web:  color(), oklab(), oklch(), and color-mix().
Your websites can now show colors redder than #FF0000. Sounds…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Suppose you're using a password manager (if you don't, go and install one now — the internet is a scary place, and breaches happen all the time); you might have run into situations when your password manager comes up with a nicely cryptic and unique password that'll be rejected by a website because it's too long, uses not allowed characters or other nonsense.
If that happens, you should evaluate if you really want to subscribe somewhere, but it's also poor UX. Wouldn't it be great if there was a declarative way to inform password managers about supported password combinations?
It turns out there is — sort of. If you're in the Apple ecosystem and use the native password management tools, Safari supports a passwordrules HTML attribute to control its password autofill feature. 1Password also seems to pick up the attribute.
<input type="password" 
  passwordrules="minlength: 8; required: lower; required: upper; required: digit; required: [_];">

If you want to play around with passwordrules, Apple provides a tool to generate rules and you can test it out in Safari. The feature worked for simple configurations but enforcing Unicode characters such as ⭐ didn't work for me. 😅
As far as I can tell, there's no proper spec about the HTML attribute yet, but it's up for discussion since 2018 (thanks Dennis Schubert). And while digging deeper (thanks Thomas Broyer), I discovered that passwordrules probably won't go anywhere soon because Mozilla doesn't think it's a good idea.
Let's see how this turns out!
Multiple folks pointed out that passwort restrictions are useless because the only thing protecting against a brutforce attack is password length. I'm no security expert and might do some reading to update the post later.

React finally shipped a working implementation of Server Components in Next.js. I haven't played with them yet, but it seems they involve heavy bundler magic to make them feel like good old PHP.
