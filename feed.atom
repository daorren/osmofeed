SwissMap: A Smaller, Faster Hash Table for Go — The creators of the DoltDB database have open-sourced SwissMap, a Go port of a hash map from Google’s Abseil library. It uses less memory than Go’s built-in map and is well-suited for performance-sensitive contexts where memory use for large hash tables is a concern – though, as always, there are tradeoffs to consider.

And that's no surprise. Have you tried using the web without JS? If so, I doubt you've come very far. JavaScript drives everything from small widgets and form validation to full-fledged all-in JS sites.
Keep in mind that disabled JavaScript is not the primary reason why applications break. As the friends at GOV.UK rightfully say there are plenty of reasons why JavaScript fails. A browser extension could block it, the visitor might be on a flaky network, there could be a DNS issue, ... the possibilities are endless.

It’s a fork of Go’s own fieldalignment tool that skips generated or test files, skips specially marked structs, doesn’t drop comments, and similar DX enhancements.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I live in Germany, and while many think we have things in order here, we still need to sort out bureaucracy. It's a clu**fu** at best because German officials rely on paper – paper and handwritten signatures.
It can go so far that a scanned document image is preferred over a nice and sharp PDF. I don't own a printer, let alone a scanner, so occasionally, I drag myself to the local copy shop to do official business.
Until now! I've been browsing Hacker News, and the shell script below takes a PDF and makes it look like it's been scanned.
#!/bin/sh
ROTATION=$(shuf -n 1 -e '-' '')$(shuf -n 1 -e $(seq 0.05 .5))

convert -density 150 $1 \
  -linear-stretch '1.5%x2%' \
  -rotate ${ROTATION} \
  -attenuate '0.01' \
  +noise  Multiplicative \
  -colorspace 'gray' $2
  

Suppose you called the scrip index.sh you can now run the following command...
./index.sh original.pdf scanned.pdf

... to scan your PDFs without a physical scanner.
Side note: the convert command is part of the imagemagick tools and wasn't available on my machine. You might have to install it first. A brew install imagemagick did the trick for me, though.

You might have noticed that hosting providers are keen on supporting (employing) framework maintainers. Netlify sponsors 11ty and Solid development and even bought Gatsby.
Vercel, on the other hand, obviously develops Next.js, but also hired Svelte lead developer Rich Harris.
Everybody tries to be friends with the framework folks. And that's no surprise – if a trending framework recommends a hoster, chances are high that users will try things out there. No complicated math here... 🤷‍♂️

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've stumbled upon a relatively new VS Code extension (more about it in a second) and just went on a journey to clean up VS Code. I removed ten extensions and am now with 25 that I use actively, more or less.
The best extensions blend in so well that you'll be surprised that VS Code doesn't offer certain functionality natively. It's the ones "fixing" the editor that stand out!
And I have a hunch that "Better Folding" created by Mohammad Baqer will be one of them. Let me quickly share three extensions I forgot I installed but don't want to miss.
The newbie first: Better Folding

The Better Folding extension was released in 2023 and only has a few downloads yet, but after looking at it, I immediately realized that code folding in VS Code could be better.
VS Code's folding is somehow standing in my way, and that's why I'm not using it that often...
Check out "Better Folding's" improvements!
Everything's nicely configurable, too! I bet VS Code will adopt all these folding features when the extension takes off!
HTML End Tag Labels

And speaking of code folding: to navigate nested HTML structures, I used to collapse certain areas to keep an overview. The HTML End Tag Labels extension makes HTML editing so much easier.
Better Comments

And if a code base comes with lots of comments, Better Comments' TODO highlighting makes it easier to grasp what's essential!
That's all for today's VS Code spring cleaning. If you use extensions that blend in as nicely as these three, shoot them my way!

Why Turborepo is Migrating From Go to Rust — Turborepo is a high performance JavaScript build system built upon Go but.. perhaps not for much longer. Why? It mostly seems subjective, but you might find their arguments interesting.

Code Coverage for Go Integration Tests — While Go has had coverage support at the package test level for almost ten years, coverage for integration tests run outside of the go test mechanism has been non-existent. With Go 1.20, it’s possible to instrument a binary and generate coverage files for both the module code and dependent packages.

Within a day, a furious gallery owner told me I had broken Google. What? Google doesn't work anymore? What happened? Well... I didn't care about the URLs and changed everything to WordPress's default schema.
The lesson: Cool URIs don't change. And I've just read an article by Tim Berners-Lee (the inventor of the World Wide Web) written in 1998.
That was fifteen years ago, and yet it holds much wisdom.
When you change a URI on your server, you can never completely tell who will have links to the old URI.

I don't hold strong opinions here, but I do care about setting expectations appropriately. When I update a dependency, I'd like to know if there are expected breaking changes or if it's supposed to be a smooth ride.
The idea of a breaking change is by itself very complicated. Let's say there's a bug in your software; when people already use your code there's a slight chance that a bug fix could also be a breaking change.
But I'll leave this topic for another day...
