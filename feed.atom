        <updated>2023-03-10T23:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've stumbled upon a relatively new VS Code extension (more about it in a second) and just went on a journey to clean up VS Code. I removed ten extensions and am now with 25 that I use actively, more or less.
The best extensions blend in so well that you'll be surprised that VS Code doesn't offer certain functionality natively. It's the ones "fixing" the editor that stand out!
And I have a hunch that "Better Folding" created by Mohammad Baqer will be one of them. Let me quickly share three extensions I forgot I installed but don't want to miss.
The newbie first: Better Folding

The Better Folding extension was released in 2023 and only has a few downloads yet, but after looking at it, I immediately realized that code folding in VS Code could be better.
VS Code's folding is somehow standing in my way, and that's why I'm not using it that often...
Check out "Better Folding's" improvements!
Everything's nicely configurable, too! I bet VS Code will adopt all these folding features when the extension takes off!
HTML End Tag Labels

And speaking of code folding: to navigate nested HTML structures, I used to collapse certain areas to keep an overview. The HTML End Tag Labels extension makes HTML editing so much easier.
Better Comments

And if a code base comes with lots of comments, Better Comments' TODO highlighting makes it easier to grasp what's essential!
That's all for today's VS Code spring cleaning. If you use extensions that blend in as nicely as these three, shoot them my way!

Code Coverage for Go Integration Tests — While Go has had coverage support at the package test level for almost ten years, coverage for integration tests run outside of the go test mechanism has been non-existent.

Within a day, a furious gallery owner told me I had broken Google. What? Google doesn't work anymore? What happened? Well... I didn't care about the URLs and changed everything to WordPress's default schema.
The lesson: Cool URIs don't change. And I've just read an article by Tim Berners-Lee (the inventor of the World Wide Web) written in 1998.
That was fifteen years ago, and yet it holds much wisdom.

I don't hold strong opinions here, but I do care about setting expectations appropriately. When I update a dependency, I'd like to know if there are expected breaking changes or if it's supposed to be a smooth ride.
The idea of a breaking change is by itself very complicated. Let's say there's a bug in your software; when people already use your code there's a slight chance that a bug fix could also be a breaking change.

git clean .

The clean command removes untracked files from your Git working tree, and while that's sometimes exactly what you want, you should really run the command with caution.
You're probably frustrated when you want to start over, but you should be sure you want to throw away everything. Some files might still be valuable. If you run git clean, they're gone — end of story.
By default, Git will not allow you to clean up a repository unless you have clean.requireForce set to false. But you know how it is: an innocent -f is quickly added.
I learned today that git clean (and other commands) support a --dry-run option.
git clean --dry-run .
Would remove not-important.js
Would remove untracked-but-very-important.js

If you want a shorter command line option, use the very intuitive (not!) -n argument.
git clean -n .
Would remove not-important.js
Would remove untracked-but-very-important.js

The command prints out what it would remove without doing any damage. Handy! It also comes with a useful interactive mode to handle many untracked files.
git clean -i
Would remove the following items:
  not-important.js   untracked-but-very-important.js
  
*** Commands ***
  1: clean   2: filter by pattern   3: select by numbers   4: ask each   5: quit   6: help
What now> 4
Remove not-important.js [y/N]? y
Remove untracked-but-very-important.js [y/N]? N
Removing not-important.js

You can choose between pattern matching or checking each file one by one in the interactive mode. Nice one, Git! 💪
But what about other Git commands? Most of the other dry runs don't seem very exciting to me because, as said, most of the Git operations are reversible. But one that I could see come in handy is a git remote prune dry run to avoid removing remote branches. But that's about it. 🤷‍♂️

Opting In to Transparent Telemetry in Go — A debate around adding telemetry to the Go toolchain has been rolling for the past few weeks. Now there’s a new development: “By far the most common suggestion was to make the system opt-in (default off) instead of opt-out (default on). I have revised the design to do that.” There are some downsides to that, of course.

    const listener = (state) => _setState(state);
    listeners[key].push(listener);
    // Cleanup when unmounting
    return () => {
      const index = listeners[key].indexOf(listener);
      listeners[key].splice(index, 1);
    };
  }, []);
  return [state, setState];
}

You can then use the defined useGlobalState hook to share or update application state across components. 💪
const [state, setState] = useGlobalState('someUniqueKey', INITIAL_STATE);

Are there downsides to this pattern? I don't know, and I'm a little puzzled why I haven't seen this userland hook before, but if you think useGlobalState is a bad idea, let me know!
If you want to learn more, Yoav explains how it works on his blog!

Purego: A Dynamic Way to Call C Functions from Go Without Cgo — No C means you can build for other platforms easily without a target C compiler/toolchain. No wrapper functions either. One of the contributors noted on HN: "It uses the same mechanisms that Cgo does to switch to the system stack and then call the C code. Purego just avoids having to need a C toolchain to cross compile code that calls into C from Go."

Do you know that the new media query range syntax is almost cross-browser supported? Or that client-side navigation has hard-to-ignore accessibility impacts? Or that native CSS nesting shipped in Safari?
All the answers and much more are included in this week's Web Weekly. 🫣
One of the Arc browser's features is "Boosts" which allow you to inject custom CSS and JavaScript into sites. The idea is not new, but the feature is built into the browser.
BTW: I still have five Arc invites hit reply if you want to try it.
I always wonder if people really change sites because the chances are high that things break with a site update. Is that worth it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My dotfiles are powering multiple machines, and overall I've been happy with them. They include hand-written shell scripts to create symlinks, download all desktop apps and CLI tools, and get my preferred system settings in place. But overall, they've become a Frankenstein over time because many random scripts are doing random things. And obviously, I failed to document what's going on properly.
Sure, scripts have to run to install stuff, but for config file management, most solutions I've seen seemed too complicated to keep some files in sync. And I really don't want to use a dotfile framework to pull some configuration files.
What if there is a way to tweak Git and track all the .*rc and config files?
"Dotfiles management" describes Git magic to track all files somewhere on your machine from a single .git repository. Yes, your read that right. Any file and anywhere.
alias dotfiles='git --git-dir=/home/mx/.dotfiles --work-tree=/'

That's right; there's a .git folder somewhere on your machine (/home/mx/.dotfiles in the example), and it'll track all the files no matter where they're located, thanks to the --work-tree argument. Then there's no symlink dance!
With some additional configuration, you can add and sync files across machines without scripts using dotfiles add or dotfiles commit. It's all just plain Git.
This dotfiles approach is by far the smartest I've seen, and I'll definitely give it a shot when I fiddle with my system config the next time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm continuing my journey of learning TypeScript, and it's a wild ride. Sometimes I feel like I have things under control, but other times, I'm looking at a type definition at work, and all I can do is scratch my head in confusion. It'll be a long journey!
Today I discovered a somewhat basic but very useful feature that's in TS since 3.4 (released in 2019). That's a century in web development, but hey, I'm still starting out!
How to narrow types with const assertions

Let's look at a trivial example.
const resource = {id: '123'};

if (resource.id === '234') {
  console.log('yay!');
}

If you look at it, you'll probably see that there's no way this code logs out yay! because the resource.id isn't changed to 234. But TypeScript doesn't know that, and if you inspect the resulting type, you'll find that resource.id is just a string. And that does make sense because it doesn't matter if you declare an object with the const keyword; you can still change the properties as you like.
But what if you want to treat the object as truly immutable? Turns out, you can narrow types and explicitly tell TypeScript that resource won't change with two words — as const.
const resource = {id: '123'} as const;

if (resource.id === '234') {
  console.log('yay');
}

And voilà — look at this extra level of type safety! 👏
Now that TypeScript knows that resource is immutable, it narrows the property type from string to 123, and it complains if you're trying to alter the constant object. That's pretty handy for all sorts of operations!
The TypeScript docs are a quick read if you want to learn more.
