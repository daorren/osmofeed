        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today I learned a small trick about CSS media queries that can help to save some bytes on the wire. You might know that you can check for user preferences using media queries.
Let's take the prefers-reduced-motion media query as an example.👇
@media screen and (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  /* stop all these animations */
}

You can use the prefers-reduced-motion query to stop animating elements when users prefer not to see motion and animations (learn more about why you should do that on CSS-Tricks). The query can have two different values: no-preference and reduce.
If you have used this media query before, you might know that you can also use its short variant and drop the reduce value. The media query will behave the same.

        <link href="https://www.stefanjudis.com/snippets/how-to-extract-text-from-an-image-via-the-cli/"/>
        <updated>2021-08-01T19:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I came across a post by Simon Willison that described how to use the tesseract CLI command to extract text from an image. I took the opportunity to fiddle around with some shell scripting and added an extract-text-from-image command to my dotfiles. It uses tesseract to analyze an image, creates a txt file with the embedded text, copies the ebedded text to the clipboard, and deletes the txt file again.
The tesseract command was available on my machine. If it's not available on yours, install it via your favorite package manager.
Find extract-image-from-texts last iteration below:
function extract-text-from-image() {
  if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Please specify the file you want to scan.";
    echo "  -> extract-text-from-image /some/path/image.png";
    return 1;
  fi

  TARGET_DIR=$(dirname "$1");
  FILENAME=$(basename -- "$1");
  FILENAME_WITHOUT_EXTENSION="${FILENAME%.*}";

  tesseract "$1" "$TARGET_DIR/$FILENAME_WITHOUT_EXTENSION" -l eng txt || return 1;
  pbcopy < "$TARGET_DIR/$FILENAME_WITHOUT_EXTENSION.txt";
  rm "$TARGET_DIR/$FILENAME_WITHOUT_EXTENSION.txt";
  echo "🎉 Text copied to clipboard!";
}

I don't think I'll use this command daily, but I'm amazed by this piece of CLI magic.
Edit: Wesley Martin shared the macOCR project with me and it's also worth a look!

Cześć, friends!
It's been a while, but I visited my family this week! 🎉 My grandparents celebrated their 60th wedding anniversary (holy moly!), and I went home to "party" with them. It was a good week, and I hope the same applies to you!
Before we jump into web stuff, let me share something super cute (make sure to watch it until the end). 🐷


          
            
This week's Web Weekly includes:
questions to ask when interviewing for a new job
how to detect media query support
new web security features
... and, as always, GitHub repositories, a new Tiny Helper and some music.
Ready? Steady. Go!

Kilian Valkhof published Detecting media query support in CSS and JavaScript and I had to read it a few times to understand its logic.
In short: that's how you can detect if a browser supports prefers-reduced-data CSS media query:
/* Apply if prefers-reduced-data is supported */
@media not all and (prefers-reduced-data), (prefers-reduced-data) {
  ...
}

In long: read Killian's post.

And while I was aware that the attribute is important, I didn't know that it also affects how browsers deal with long words and hyphenation.
hyphens: auto and the lang attribute

If you're displaying text with long words in narrow containers, you might run into overflow situations. Long words will break out of their containers.





          
            
If you look at the overflowing words and the container width, the only solution is to break the words into pieces and add hyphens.
The hyphens CSS property can help here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This post is a quick one for my bookmarks. Taylor Hunt published this "pixelate SVG filter" on CodePen. I didn't get into understanding how it exactly works, but it might come in handy some day.
<svg>
  <filter id="pixelate" x="0" y="0">
    <feFlood x="4" y="4" height="2" width="2"/>    
    <feComposite width="10" height="10"/>
    <feTile result="a"/>
    <feComposite in="SourceGraphic" in2="a" operator="in"/>
    <feMorphology operator="dilate" radius="5"/>
  </filter>
  
  <image width="100%" height="100%" 
         preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid slice"
         filter="url(#pixelate)"
         xlink:href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s.cdpn.io/183091/grateful_dog.jpg"/>
  <image width="100%" height="100%" 
         preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid slice"
         clip-path="url(#half)"
         xlink:href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s.cdpn.io/183091/grateful_dog.jpg"/>
  <clipPath id="half">
    <rect width="100%" height="50%"/>
  </clipPath>
</svg>

And this code renders like that. 😲

          
            
Ryan shared that the effect works as an inline SVG/CSS filter. After quickly testing it, it only seems to work in Firefox, though.
It's fascinating what SVG filters can do. Maybe I'll properly learn all these SVG filters one day.

The challenge of function parameters

I'm always in favor of avoiding more than three function parameters or single boolean function parameters. If you're not following such rules, code becomes hard to follow and function calls hard to understand.
Consider the following example:
function doSomething(isGreat, doLater, cleanUpAfterwards) {
  console.log(isGreat, doLater, cleanUpAfterwards);
}

// uff, that's hard to understand ...
doSomething(true, false, true);

At first sight, the doSomething function definition might not look too bad, but when you …]]></summary>

γεια, friends!
A few people reached out to me this week to check if I'm okay with the flooding going on in Germany. Thank you, I am, and I really hope the same applies to you!
This week's highlight was that I started reading On writing well. Unsurprisingly, the book teaches how to write better non-fiction. I'm only a few chapters in, and I like it a lot. Get ready for it; my writing might become more concise soon!
Before we jump into web stuff, let me share a comic about the state of the web with you.



          
            
This week's Web Weekly includes:
loops in JavaScript
the git worktree command
natural shadows in CSS
... and, as always, GitHub repositories, a new Tiny Helper and some music.
Ready? Steady. Go!
The various loops in JavaScript

A URL such as cache:https://www.stefanjudis.com redirects to the recent Google-indexed version available under http://webcache.googleusercontent.com.
Edit: As it turns out this is a Google Search rather than a browser feature. When Google is your default search engine, the cache: prefix works because it works in Google Search itself. 🤦‍♂️

        <link href="https://www.stefanjudis.com/snippets/a-natural-shadow-with-svg-filters/"/>
        <updated>2021-07-17T22:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just cleaned up all the open tabs in my browser and discovered a Tweet from Jamie Kyle (if you open it, yes, I had that tab open for six months 🙈). Jamie described how he implemented a natural shadow component using React and SVG filters. The shadow reflects the element's colors, and they are what give the effect its natural look.

          
            
Jamie wraps an image into an SVG element and uses SVG filter elements to create the beautiful shadow.
That approach got me thinking, a while ago, I published a blog post describing how to inline SVG filters in CSS. It turns out you can apply Jamie's SVG filter without React or wrapping everything in an SVG element. Pure CSS does the job! 🎉
Here's the CSS class with the inlined SVG filter.
.natural-shadow {
  /* inline the SVG filter */
  filter: url('data:image/svg+xml,\
    <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">\
      <filter id="naturalShadow" x="0" y="0" width="2" height="2">\
        <feOffset in="SourceGraphic" dx="3" dy="3" />\
        <feGaussianBlur stdDeviation="5" result="blur" />\
        <feMerge>\
          <feMergeNode in="blur"/>\
          <feMergeNode in="SourceGraphic"/>\
        </feMerge>\
      </filter>\
    </svg>#naturalShadow');
}

What's cool about this approach is that the SVG filter is visually applied to the element and its children. You can apply it to a wrapper div such as the one below.
<div class="natural-shadow">
  <img src="/your-image.png" alt="Your iamge">
</div>

See the result in action. This shadow is done in pure CSS (sort of 🙈). 👇
As stated in my previous blog post, Safari seems to have some issues with inlined SVG filters. If you know what's the problem, please let me know!

Ciao, friends!
I'm back from my vacation! It was full of tours on "shitty bikes" and long walks in Amsterdam. I really like the vibe of the city! It was perfect trip to relax and decompress. And in the meantime I got my first vaccine shot, too! Normality is approaching! 🎉
Before we jump into web stuff, let me share some wisdom I saw on Twitter.



          
            
This week's Web Weekly includes:
an extensive guide to accessible components
new CSS viewport units
maybe unnecessary browser functionalities
... and, as always, GitHub repositories, a new Tiny Helper and some music.
Ready? Steady. Go!
Feedback for better native elements

        <updated>2021-07-10T21:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chris Coyier shared a fascinating post describing a bug that only appeared on low-resolution devices. The post brings up the interesting problem of low-resolution devices. I usually work on a MacBook Pro and a decent monitor so that I rarely see and check the things I build in lower resolutions.
Developer tools offer ways to emulate lower DPR (device pixel ratio), and tools such as dpilove indeed show different resolution values after adjusting the DPR. However, the website still looks sharp and crisp on my MacBook. I wonder if I'm missing something here?




          
            
After reading Chris' post, I learned that you can enable low-resolution mode when developing on a high-resolution Mac. Open the app information for your browser, tick the box for "Open in Low Resolution" and start the application.




          
            
When you then open the app (my example shows Chrome Canary), you see a clear visual difference. The website is rendered in low resolution, everything is a bit "blurry", and even the browser frame and controls are not rendered in sharp retina style anymore.
That's good to know for future debugging sessions that deal with device pixel ratio!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just saw an npm package that makes copying and pasting of shell commands easier. Documented shell commands often include a leading $ character (e.g. $ npm install whatever) to signal that the code block is a shell command. And when you're like me, you always copy and paste the $ sign with the command, leading to a command not found: $ error in your terminal.





          
            
And while it's not a huge deal, you have to either carefully copy the command not to include the $ sign or paste the command into your terminal and remove the dollar manually. There has to be a better way...
... and that's where the mentioned npm package comes into play. The package provides a global $ command that behaves like a proxy on your command line. The $ command simply runs all passed-in argument…]]></summary>
