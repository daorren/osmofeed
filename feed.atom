This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be "hh:mm:ss" or "mm:ss" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I went into the rabbit hole of writing shell scripting today. 🙈 The goal: saving keystrokes and manually ran commands when starting to work on a project.
Here's the result. 👇
The video above shows a custom dev command that:
navigates into a project
runs npm run dev
opens VS Code
The exciting part is that it supports auto-completion to pass paths to projects with a working npm run dev command quickly.
A shell function to run multiple commands

To define a custom shell function that runs various commands add the following lines to your .zshrc or .bashrc.
function dev() {
  echo "Running 'npm run dev' in $1 ..."
  cd ~/Projects/"$1" || return
  code .
  npm run dev
}

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ES modules are still reasonably new in Node.js land (they're stable since Node 14). Modules come with a built-in module system and features such as top-level await.
I just read an informative post on ES modules by Pawel Grzybek and learned that you can't import JSON files in ES modules today. That's a real bummer because I'm pretty used to doing const data = require('./some-file.json') in Node.js.
While it will be possible to import JSON from within modules eventually, the implementation is still behind a flag (--experimental-json-modules).
This post includes ways to deal with JSON in ES modules today.
Option 1: Read and parse JSON files yourself

The Node.js documentation advises to use the fs module and do the work of reading the files and parsing it yourself.
import { readFile } from 'fs/promises';
const json = JSON.parse(
  await readFile(
    new URL('./some-file.json', import.meta.url)
  )
);

Option 2: Leverage the CommonJS require function to load JSON files

The documentation also states that you can use createRequire to load JSON files. This is the way Pawel advises in his blog post.
createRequire allows you to construct a CommonJS require function so that you can use typical CommonJS features in Node.js EcmaScript modules.
import { createRequire } from "module";
const require = createRequire(import.meta.url);
const data = require("./data.json");

How should you load JSON files?

I don't know. 🤷‍♂️ Neither option feels good, and I'll probably stick to the first option because it's more understandable.
Let's see when stable JSON modules land in Node.js!
