        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been writing JavaScript for so long that I sometimes don't see its quirks. To be fair, there are fewer quirks than ten years ago, but some things would still make great language additions. One thing that would make a lot of sense is required function parameters.
Assume you have a function that defines required arguments. And you really really want to make sure the function is called with the correct arguments by throwing an error.
Here's what you might do:
function doSomethingWithAThing(theThing) {
  if (typeof theThing === "undefined") {
    throw new Error("theThing is required");
  }
}

That's quite a bit of code for such a simple thing.
Unfortunately, you can't do something like this in JavaScript ...
function doSomethingWithAThing(
  theThing = throw new Error("theThing Is Undefined")
) {
  // ...
}

... because JavaScript doesn't like it.
Peter Kröner published a handy snippet that he carries around from project to project. The post is in German, so here's the English gist of it.
First, define a fail function.
function fail(reason, ErrorConstructor = Error) {
  throw new ErrorConstructor(reason);
}

And second... use it. 🫣
By restructuring the code and transforming the error throwing portion into an expression, you can immediately throw in case a function is called without the required parameters.
function doSomethingWithAThing(
  theThing = fail('theThing Is Undefined')
) {
  // ...
}

What a beautiful sort of one-line workaround.
Thanks Peter!

Do you know that you can use CSS Grid to animate an element's height? Have you heard of the new scrollend JavaScript event? Or do you use rel="tag" somewhere?
All the answers and much more are included in this week's Web Weekly. 🫣
Regarding forms, you should rely on the native form elements because they provide the best user experience, right?
I remember being overly excited when Safari finally started supporting date inputs two years ago.
But are these native elements really always the best choice?
Robin Thomas shared multiple reasons why the iOS date picker sucks. And I can relate — filling in a date on mobile sometimes feels like this CodePen.
But what about the other elements? Number inputs also come with quirks and different behavior across browsers. 😢

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Did you ever curse the JSON data format for not allowing comments and wondered what the heck? Yeah, same here.
Surprisingly, JSON, in its initial spec, did allow comments, but comment support was removed for three reasons:
People put parsing instructions into comments breaking portability across platforms and languages.
Comments introduced complexity that might not be needed for a data format.
The JSON creators wanted it to be compatible with early YAML versions.
It's a bummer because JSON outgrew its serial data use case, and it's widespread to have JSON config files these days. :/
Pawel Grzybek pointed out that the lack of comments and other features led to the JSON5 spec, which aimed to be a JSON extension suitable for config files and was adopted by VS Code and many other software products today.
If you want to learn more, here's why comments were removed on YouTube.

I knew creating this CSS effect wouldn't be too hard, but fiddling with CSS gradients is not my strong suit. Unfortunately, my Google foo failed me. And if your search terms include "CSS" and "grid" you'll get only tutorials to use and create "CSS grids".  🤦‍♂️
The only solution was to tweak random Codepens, and I spent a good half an hour creating vertical and horizontal lines in CSS.
So! If you, dear reader, are on the hunt for a quick CSS background grid generator, you reached your final destination!
Here's my contribution to the internet. 👇
