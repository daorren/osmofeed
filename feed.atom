        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here's a trick question: how would you select the following HTML element in JavaScript?
<div id="#">Select me!</div>

Oddly, this element's id is a #. But as far as I can tell, even though it's uncommon it's still a perfectly valid HTML attribute. So, how would you query this element?
You surely could use the good old document.getElementById()...
console.log(document.getElementById('#')); // <div id="#">...

This works, but I rarely use getElementById because it limits me to select elements via an id. Duh! ðŸ˜…
document.querySelector, on the other hand, is more flexible and allows any DOM element to be queried with a CSS selector.
But can you select this "hash id element" with a CSS selector using querySelector? Turns out you can't.
console.log(document.querySelector('##'));
// SyntaxError: â€¦]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Happy Monday, party people!

Should your JS projects always include a build step? Is the dotenv npm package now obsolete? And how could you create advanced transitions with the linear() easing function?
This week's Web Weekly includes all the answers and much more. Enjoy!
I had coffee with a friend the other day, and unfortunately, she's looking for a new job. She entered tech, joined a friendly team with wonderful colleagues, and then... her company went bust.
Now, she has a year of experience, and as it turns out, finding a junior web dev position is tough.
When I started, I was incredibly lucky. A friend introduced me to a CTO, I "randomly" got an internship, and just like that, I entered a team with the kindest people teaching me all the things I didn't learn in Uni. It was this team tâ€¦]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's news on the URL validation front in JavaScript land! After all these years of cursing JavaScript for not having an easy way to validate a URL, there's a new method in town â€” URL.canParse()!
URL.canParse('https://www.stefanjudis.com'); // true 
URL.canParse('www.stefanjudis.com'); // false

Hallelujah! URL.canParse() is a quick way to figure out if a string is a valid URL. But before we all get too excited, URL.canParse() is not cross-browser supported when writing this post. But you can find up-to-date browser support information below. ðŸ‘‡
