What's the status of Apple's PWA disaster? Should you self-host everything to avoid serverless horror stories? And what do you need to know about the new core web vital INP?
Turn on the Web Weekly tune and find all the answers below. Enjoy!

Everybody's testing React Server components these days. And apart from the smaller bundle sizes (yay!) and massively increased build complexity (not yay!), the idea of streaming (some might call it simply lazy loading) content is quite nice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here's a quick tip from the excellent vscode.email newsletter: VS Code allows you to mark files as readonly.
When would you use it?
Many applications include generated files, which could be data models or schemas. These files are often checked into version control and only updated periodically. People know they shouldn't touch these files because they start with a big warning — do not edit this file manually.
Here's a file from my current project.
/**
 * ...
 *
 * NOTE: This class is auto generated by OpenAPI Generator (https://openapi-generator.tech).
 * https://openapi-generator.tech
 * Do not edit the class manually.
 */

Do people read all the comments? No. Does this prevent me from changing the file manually? Also, no.
I love the idea of solving this problem at the editor level.
The "Readonly include" option accepts files or glob patterns.
And voila! I can't edit these generated files in VS Code anymore now.
The trick is not to define this setting in your global config but rather in your workspace or project config at your-project/.vscode/settings.json.
{
  "files.readonlyInclude": {
    "src/app/core/generated-models/**": true
  }
}

Now, no VS Code user will edit the generated files. Win win!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have the constant urge to "do stuff". My to-do and idea lists are endless collections of things I'd love to do one day. But there's a problem — my side hustle schedule is pretty busy already.
I want to keep this blog active. I run a weekly web development newsletter. I maintain some open-source projects. I collect online tools.
These projects alone eat a good chunk of my free time, and while I love doing them, they add up. There are only so many hours in the day.
For years, I ran the @randomMDN Twitter bot. Then Elmo broke the Twitter APIs. I was puzzled. "This is one of my projects; it can't just be over, can it?" buzzed in my head. I've had a hard time letting go, I guess.
Fast forward. I hadn't had time to fix or deal with the problem, and it was over. Just like that, one of my projects dropped off the list.
Lovely people ported Random MDN to the Fediverse if you want random web dev facts in your feed.
I realized I treat most projects as "forever projects".
Of course, I work on this project every week. Of course, I'll answer these GitHub issues over the weekend. Of course, I keep this online resource up-to-date. And, of course, this isn't a sustainable.
As Jamie Wilkinson puts it, he doesn't want to do forever projects anymore. Everything has a shelf life. Kicking things off is great, but letting things go is as important.
Treat beginnings like endings: celebrate them, document them.
It's simple: to have time for new projects and passions, one has to let go.
By ending well, you give yourself the freedom to begin again.
Great advice.

Remember Web Weekly 121? It was when Apple announced that they'd allow different browser engines on iOS to comply with the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA). We all celebrated the open web for a second only to discover the catch.
Only EU citizens will be allowed to use different browser engines. EU-only? That's fishy, but it got worse.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[htmx has been pretty loud lately because it moves functionality, like swapping out DOM elements into declarative HTML. Love it or hate it, I think it's a "fresh" approach to the overcomplicated world of JS frameworks.
<script src="https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@1.9.10"></script>
<!-- have a button POST a click via AJAX -->
<button hx-post="/clicked" hx-swap="outerHTML">
  Click Me
</button>

Add the 14kb compressed file to your sites and create dynamic interactions. Everything's just a hx-whatever attribute away. Sweet!
Could you do similar things with less JavaScript? And while I wouldn't recommend using htmz in production, it does some HTML-swapping magic with 176 JS bytes. How? With very creative iframe usage.
<iframe hidden name=htmz onload="setTimeout(()=>document.querySelector(this.contentWindow.location.hash||null)?.replaceWith(...this.contentDocument.body.childNodes))"></iframe>

<!-- Loads /flower.html onto #my-element -->
<a href="/flower.html#my-element" target=htmz>Flower</a>

Is the project a joke? Sorta — maybe not. But whether we talk about htmx or htmz or whatever comes next, it becomes clear that we're lacking some HTML primitives. But maybe frames were already good enough? #oldIsNew 😅
