I rarely use tables because I usually don't deal with tabular data. But suppose you're building complex tables with cells spanning multiple columns or rows. In that case, you can use headers to define which table header elements are connected to the particular table cell.
Here are some resources to read more about it:

Next week I'll start my new job, and I can't wait to set up my new working laptop. Why?
First of all, it's a new Mac, and who doesn't like unboxing these. But also, years ago, I invested some time into my dotfiles. Today, I just love kicking off a script to set up a new machine entirely. If you don't have your computer configuration in code, you should consider it. You'll use it your entire life!
My dotfiles are a combination of configuration files and scripts installing and linking all sorts of things. Unfortunately, I failed to document them properly, but they're still good enough to poke around and give you some ideas.
Here are some examples to get you started:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Whenever you add a JavaScript click handler to DOM elements other than the good old button, you should hold on and ask yourself if you're using the correct element. Semantic HTML provides additional functionality to assistive technology and is usually more accessible than clickable div soup.
For example, buttons come with keyboard accessibility features built-in. They're focusable and can be clicked by pressing Enter or Space.
But did you know that the two keys click buttons differently?
Enter clicks a focused button on keydown
Space clicks a focused button on keyup
I found this little fun fact on Adrian's blog. Check out the post to learn more and see this click behavior in action.
