Let's talk about a never-ending programming argument: TABS vs. SPACES. I know, I know... but hear me out! üòâ
I don't care too much about it because wrangling code into whatever coding convention is an editor's job. Prettier for the win!
But I've always been in "the space camp" for my projects. It's my code, and I make the rules, right?
This week I took a big step, moved camps and changed my first repo to be tabs-first!
So, what changed my opinion?
The Prettier maintainers consider moving to tabs with their next major release because it saves bytes and is more flexible. Let's dive into these points.
I converted all JS files (including all node_modules) of my blog's code base to tabs and saved a whooping 11MB on my hard drive. So, this is a weak argument at best.

I applied this change to this blog's repository, and a problem came to light. If you change the formatting of hundreds of files, you're messing with your Git history. git blame becomes pretty useless. Thousands of lines will be marked with an unimportant formatting change.
I started googling around to find out how to ignore commits in Git and VS code...
Ignore commits via --ignore-rev

If you use git blame on the command line, the --ignore-rev option lets you blame a file without considering this nasty formatting commit.
git blame --ignore-rev a926bba49c index.js

This is great but didn't help me because I rarely use git blame on the command line, and even if I would, I wouldn't want to always think ‚Ä¶]]></summary>

git push --force origin main
git push -f origin main
git push origin +main

One hand the + saves some characters and somehow feels less scary to me, but on the other hand is force pushing only a single character typo away. That's scary!
Force pushing is dangerous. If you collaborate with others on a project, consider using the --force-with-lease flag instead.

And while I could run all of them with the node binary (node create-thumbnails.js), I prefer to remove the file extension and make the scripts executables (./create-thumbnails). This approach saves characters, and makes me feel like a hacker!
My steps to create an executable are:
Remove the .js file extension (mv create-thumbnails.js create-thumbnails).
Make the file executable  (chmod 744 create-thumbnails).
Add a shebang (#!/usr/bin/env node) to signal that the executing shell should use the node binary.
Et voil√†, you just created a Node.js executable!

What new CSS features are you most excited about? It's hands-down the :has() pseudo-class for me, because :has() flips CSS around, and content will finally be able to influence styling!
Dave Rupert published a post including this :has() selector to style the first element but only if it's included in an odd-numbered list.
But there's a surprise: you don't even need :has() for this. Temani Afif shared that you can do it with nth-last-of-type, too.
And while we're at it, do you remember this snippet? It's a CSS quantity query to select li elements, but only if there are three or more list elements. ü§Ø

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Have you heard of the new script type "importmap"? Import maps aren't listed in the MDN script element compatibility data yet, but according to caniuse.com, Chromium ships them, and Firefox implements them behind a feature flag.
Import maps will simplify frontend tooling. üéâ If you ship ES modules (ESM), the new script type enables you to rewrite ugly, complicated, and absolute file paths to file path identifiers.
<script type="importmap">
{
  "imports": {
    "dayjs": "https://cdn.skypack.dev/dayjs@1.10.7",
  }
}
</script>
<script type="module">
  import dayjs from 'dayjs';

  // do stuff with 'dayjs'
</script>

But making imports easier to write isn't the only benefit of using import maps!
Import maps enable longer cache duration

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Semantic HTML is the foundation of accessible websites. Correct and meaningful elements enable assistive technology to provide a site's information in a different form or shape. A screen reader, for example, takes a site and reads it out for the visitor. These cases show why semantic HTML matters!
And yet here I am after all these years of advocating for using strong (strong importance, seriousness, or urgency) and em (stress emphasis) instead of b (bold) and i (idiomatic text ‚Äì italic), only to learn that screen readers don't announce strong or em.
And while I'm not a daily screen reader user, and VoiceOver isn't the only one out there, a quick test on my Mac proves it.
Screen reader example not announcing strong or em elements.
