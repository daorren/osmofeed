        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[JavaScript is always good for a surprise, isn't it?
Nicholas C. Zakas published a discovery that made my head spin. Do you know the array method every?
This is how MDN describes what it does:
The every() method of Array instances tests whether all elements in the array pass the test implemented by the provided function. It returns a Boolean value.
Cool, that makes sense.
const collection = ['great', 'nope', 'great'];
const allItemsAreGreat = collection.every((item) => item === 'great'); // false

But now, see what happens when you use every with an empty array.
[].every((item) => item === 'great'); // true
[].every((item) => item !== 'great'); // true

Whoops?! I didn't expect that every() will tell me that every item matches my condition if there are none. That's not how my brain works.
When using the array method, you have to flip around your mindset. Here's Nicholas:
I’d suggest changing the way you read every() calls when you come across them. Instead of reading every() as “does every item in this array match this condition?” read it as, “is there any item in this array that doesn’t match this condition?”.
And it gets every weirder. Check the results for an empty array with some().
[].some((item) => item === 'great'); // false
[].some((item) => item !== 'great'); // false

Oh boy... Why do the array methods behave that way? The answer is Math, and if you want to dive deeper, check Nicholas' post. 💯

Can a regular expression freeze your JavaScript? Are you looking for some inspiration to get started with Chrome's View Transitions? And do you wish there were more ways to style select elements?

Last week's Web Weekly was marked as spam for many people. Why? It included the words "and I pay real money for sending over 4.3k emails" and apparently, this phrase rings some bells in an Apache project called "Spamassassin" used by mail providers.
The project includes a gazillion regular expressions trying to figure out if a mail is spam. Here's the one that flagged me. 🤦‍♂️
If you didn't receive last week's Web Weekly and have a moment, do me a favor and flag the email as non-spam.

You might have noticed that the last Web Weekly hit your inbox 35 days ago. It's the longest break since I started Web Weekly, and I can't say that this doesn't bug me, but I needed the break. Life was super busy; I moved, traveled countries to speak at a conference, and then got sick for a few days. It's been a ride...
But it's all good, and I'm back! Thank you to all the people who checked in with me. 💙
Let's get back to business!
Should HTML allow us to ship responsive videos? How can you optimize your fetch calls? And is there an easy way to escape CSS classes in JavaScript?
This week's Web Weekly includes all the answers and much more. Enjoy!
People were raving about barrel files this week. What's a barrel file? Here's one.

Getting started with Tailwind is straightforward (a CSS property just maps to a class name, right?), but I still have to wrap my head around advanced features like class-based element relationships.
How would you achieve the following CSS in Tailwind?

Option 1 — don't use Tailwind and go vanilla CSS

When googling around, you'll find the advice to "just use" CSS and import a CSS file somewhere. Sure, this works, but what's the point of this? Tailwind promises to solve the CSS maintenance problem…]]></summary>
