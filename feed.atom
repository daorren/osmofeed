Do you know that JavaScript provides functionality to split strings into words and sentences? Or that the CSS property visibility can be reverted for nested elements? Or how modals, popovers and dialogs differ?
All the answers and much more are included in this week's Web Weekly. 🫣
What happens when you have a container set to visibility: hidden and one of its descendants has defined visibility: visible? I mean, a visible element nested inside a hidden one shouldn't be visible, or?
Well... logic doesn't apply to visibility.
From the MDN docs visibility:
Descendants of the element will be visible if they have visibility set to visible.

      
What? 🤯
The same goes for pointer-events. Elements inside a container with defined pointer-events: none can overwrite the declaration a…]]></summary>

I haven't used this Intl object before. Let's find out what it's about!
Consider you want to split user input into sentences. It looks like a quick split() task... But there's a lot of nuance in this problem.
Here's a naive approach:
'Hello! How are you?'.split(/[.!?]/);
// ['Hello', ' How are you', '']

Using split(), you'll lose the defined separators and include all these spaces everywhere. And because it's relying on hardcoded delimiters it's not language-sensitive.
I don't speak Japanese, but how would you try to split the following string into words or sentences?
// I am a cat. My name is Tanuki.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Responsive design can be a real challenge if you're coding something that needs more than just squishing and reordering some boxes. Scott O'Hara published an article describing how to build elements that act as buttons or spans depending on the viewport size.
The trick: Scott uses CSS visibility to hide and show elements throughout the element tree conditionally.
<!-- Hide the button on smaller viewports 
     and only show the span -->
<button type="button">
  <span>Do something</spin>
</button>

Wait what? As it turns out, nested elements with different visibility properties (visible / hidden) can be visible even though their parent is hidden. 😲
Here's the MDN section about this topic.
Descendants of the element will be visible if they have visibility set to visible.
That's pretty wild!
[Interactive component: visit the article to see it...]
I'm not sure yet, what to make of this discovery. Scott's responsive pattern seems incredibly smart but also super hacky. I guess I have to sleep over it...
