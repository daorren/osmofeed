Let's have a look at three things that make internal page handling easier!
Use about instead of your specific browser scheme

As described on web.dev, Chromium browsers rewrite not-matching browser schemes, if you enter an incorrect one. You can access chrome://flags in Edge and it'll be rewritten to edge://flags. That's already pretty handy, but there's more!
You can also use the about scheme to "resolve" to the correct browser scheme. about://flags becomes chrome://flags, brave://flags, or edge://flags depending on your browser. This rewrite is a great addition and I made it a habit to use about for all internal pages already!
You can leave out the //

While playing around with the about pages, I noticed that you can make the URL even shorter. Enter about:flags and it's correctly resolved to chrome://flags. That's pretty nice, too!
about:about – a list of all internal pages

And here's the kicker, if you wonder what internal pages your Chromium browser or Firefox provides, you can enter about:about...





          
            
And there you have it, about:about lists all internal pages! I'll continue poking around all these pages now. 👋
Pssst... If you like these short learnings, I send out a weekly newsletter.

Hola friends!
Oh well... Let me be honest, my week was very long; I felt super low, binge-watched Netflix the entire weekend, and the 30+°C here in Berlin didn't help. It was pretty challenging to sit down and write this week's newsletter (but I couldn't break the 24-week streak 🙈).
I hope you had a better week and are getting ready for the summer. We all deserve it!
Before we jump into web stuff, here's a pupper from my hidden collection. It's just too cute how she leaves the scene. 😊


          
            
This week's Web Weekly includes:
GraphQL terms explained
CSS overscroll-behavior
Error cause in JavaScript
... and, as always, GitHub repositories, a new Tiny Helper and some music.
Ready? Steady. Go!
What's holding you back from being confident?

Hello friends! It's summer here in Berlin! I mean, almost... 🙈 And I might have made it to get a slight sunburn today. I also started working on a new custom element for my blog (<web-compat />) to show always-up-to-date browser support information in my blog posts. It was a good week!
Before we jump into web stuff, let me share something fascinating with you, this video shows the creation of a beautiful animation without using a computer.


          
            
This week's Web Weekly includes:
JSON modules in JavaScript
Lighthouse updates
CSS Font descriptors
... and, as always, GitHub repositories, a new Tiny Helper and some music.
Ready? Steady. Go!
The benefits of asynchronous communication

Jim shared that CSS defines system color values that follow the system color preferences (light and dark mode). If you want to learn more about the nitty-gritty details, read his post or have a look at the CSS Color Module Level 4 specification.
This post shares my discoveries after playing around with system color values such as Canvas and CanvasText.
You can find all defined system color values in the example below. Change your color preferences and see the colors below adjust!

You can see the colors react to system preferences in Chrome and Safari in the video below, too.
Here are a few things I noticed. 👇

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're using EcmaScript modules, you probably know the problem that you can't "just" import JSON files. To import and load a JSON file in an ES module, you have to do a "window.fetch dance" to request the file and parse it yourself. It's not great...
But there's hope! According to chromestatus.com, JSON Modules are shipping in Chrome 91. I gave it a quick try, and surprisingly, the following JavaScript code does not work.
<script type="module">
  import data from "./data.json";
  console.log(data);
</script>

It throws the following exception in Chrome 91:
Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript module script but the server responded with a MIME type of "application/json". Strict MIME type checking is enforced for module scripts per HTML spec.
I didn't have a detailed look at the spec discussion about this topic, but apparently, the new syntax to import JSON Modules is the following. 😲
import data from "./data.json" assert { type: "json" };

console.log(data);

That's quite something, and I have to do some reading about it. But hey, anything that makes it easier to import JSON is more than welcome!
And when there's a solution in Chrome, it can't be long until it ships in Node.js because importing JSON files in Node ES modules is not great either. 🙈
Edit: Axel Rauschmayer shared that JSON import are based on import assertions and you can read more about it on his blog.
