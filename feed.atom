Go 1.19 Released — First and foremost: “We expect almost all Go programs to continue to compile and run as before.” Phew! Go 1.19 isn't as significant a release as 1.18 and is focused more on refining what we already have, but what's new?


The garbage collector can now be given a soft memory limit. More here.
Go’s memory model now explicitly defines the behavior of the sync/atomic package, as we covered last week.
The os/exec package no longer respects relative paths in PATH lookups.
Doc comments now support links, lists and headings prefixed with #

Fixes for 'subtle issues' relating to generics.
All the typical performance tweaks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The VS Code 1.70 release notes include a nifty new experimental editor feature – sticky function signatures!
Add the following to your settings.json:
{
  "editor.experimental.stickyScroll.enabled": true
}

One might argue that it's an unnecessary feature because if you're writing clean code, you won't need it, but still... I'm there for pretty editor UI features!
Scrolling in VS Code showing that function signatures stick at the top.
      
    
After sharing this feature on Twitter, Elio Struyf pointed out that you can also configure the sticky element's background color. 🎉
{
  "workbench.colorCustomizations": {
    "editorStickyScroll.background": "#D44",
    "editorStickyScrollHover.background": "#A00"
  }
}

It might need a little tweaking to make it work with your color theme, though. 🙈
VS Code with colored sticky function signatures.

My steps to create an executable are:
Remove the .js file extension (mv create-thumbnails.js create-thumbnails).
Make the file executable  (chmod 744 create-thumbnails).
Add a shebang (#!/usr/bin/env node) to signal that the executing shell should use the node binary.
Et voilà, you just created a Node.js executable!

What new CSS features are you most excited about? It's hands-down the :has() pseudo-class for me, because :has() flips CSS around, and content will finally be able to influence styling!
Dave Rupert published a post including this :has() selector to style the first element but only if it's included in an odd-numbered list.
But there's a surprise: you don't even need :has() for this. Temani Afif shared that you can do it with nth-last-of-type, too.
And while we're at it, do you remember this snippet? It's a CSS quantity query to select li elements, but only if there are three or more list elements. 🤯

Import maps will simplify frontend tooling. 🎉 If you ship ES modules (ESM), the new script type enables you to rewrite ugly, complicated, and absolute file paths to file path identifiers.
<script type="importmap">

Correct and meaningful elements enable assistive technology to provide a site's information in a different form or shape. A screen reader, for example, takes a site and reads it out for the visitor. These cases show why semantic HTML matters!
And yet here I am after all these years of advocating for using strong (strong importance, seriousness, or urgency) and em (stress emphasis) instead of b (bold) and i (idiomatic text – italic), only to learn that screen readers don't announce strong or em.
And while I'm not a daily screen reader user, and VoiceOver isn't the only one out there, a quick test on my Mac proves it.
Screen reader example not announcing strong or em elements.

I always thought :has() is only the long-awaited "parent selector", but Jim shared that it's the "previous sibling selector", too! 🤯
/* 
  Select every <a> element that's a child of 
  a <p> element that directly precedes an <hr> element.
*/
p:has(+ hr) a { /* ... */ }

If you want to learn more, head over to Jim's blog. It's a great one!
