Profile-Guided Optimization (PGO) in Go 1.21 — PGO has been a popular topic for blog posts recently, but here’s an as-close-to-official-as-it-gets example of using it to improve code, including deeper dives into two major optimizations enabled by the process. If nothing else convinces you to give it a shot, consider this: “In Go 1.21, workloads typically get between 2% and 7% CPU usage improvements from enabling PGO.”
Michael Pratt (The Go Team) 


And if you fancy another article on the topic, Landon Clipp has another practical intro to PGO here that provides more of a "user-facing perspective."
