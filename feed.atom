Michael listens to "OMA â€“ N.Y. State of Mind" and says:
"Love this groovy instrumental version of this classic Beat by DJ Premier."

Remember Web Weekly 121? It was when Apple announced that they'd allow different browser engines on iOS to comply with the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA). We all celebrated the open web for a second only to discover the catch.
Only EU citizens will be allowed to use different browser engines. EU-only? That's fishy, but it got worse.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[htmx has been pretty loud lately because it moves functionality, like swapping out DOM elements into declarative HTML. Love it or hate it, I think it's a "fresh" approach to the overcomplicated world of JS frameworks.
<script src="https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@1.9.10"></script>
<!-- have a button POST a click via AJAX -->
<button hx-post="/clicked" hx-swap="outerHTML">
  Click Me
</button>

Add the 14kb compressed file to your sites and create dynamic interactions. Everything's just a hx-whatever attribute away. Sweet!
Could you do similar things with less JavaScript? And while I wouldn't recommend using htmz in production, it does some HTML-swapping magic with 176 JS bytes. How? With very creative iframe usage.
<iframe hidden name=htmz onload="setTimeout(()=>document.querySelector(this.contentWindow.location.hash||null)?.replaceWith(...this.contentDocument.body.childNodes))"></iframe>

<!-- Loads /flower.html onto #my-element -->
<a href="/flower.html#my-element" target=htmz>Flower</a>

Is the project a joke? Sorta â€” maybe not. But whether we talk about htmx or htmz or whatever comes next, it becomes clear that we're lacking some HTML primitives. But maybe frames were already good enough? #oldIsNew ðŸ˜…
