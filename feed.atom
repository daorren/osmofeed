        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I live in Germany, and while many think we have things in order here, we still need to sort out bureaucracy. It's a clu**fu** at best because German officials rely on paper – paper and handwritten signatures.
It can go so far that a scanned document image is preferred over a nice and sharp PDF. I don't own a printer, let alone a scanner, so occasionally, I drag myself to the local copy shop to do official business.
Until now! I've been browsing Hacker News, and the shell script below takes a PDF and makes it look like it's been scanned.
#!/bin/sh
ROTATION=$(shuf -n 1 -e '-' '')$(shuf -n 1 -e $(seq 0.05 .5))

convert -density 150 $1 \
  -linear-stretch '1.5%x2%' \
  -rotate ${ROTATION} \
  -attenuate '0.01' \
  +noise  Multiplicative \
  -colorspace 'gray' $2
  

Suppose you called the scrip index.sh you can now run the following command...
./index.sh original.pdf scanned.pdf

... to scan your PDFs without a physical scanner.
Side note: the convert command is part of the imagemagick tools and wasn't available on my machine. You might have to install it first. A brew install imagemagick did the trick for me, though.

You might have noticed that hosting providers are keen on supporting (employing) framework maintainers. Netlify sponsors 11ty and Solid development and even bought Gatsby.
Vercel, on the other hand, obviously develops Next.js, but also hired Svelte lead developer Rich Harris.
Everybody tries to be friends with the framework folks. And that's no surprise – if a trending framework recommends a hoster, chances are high that users will try things out there. No complicated math here... 🤷‍♂️

        <updated>2023-03-10T23:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've stumbled upon a relatively new VS Code extension (more about it in a second) and just went on a journey to clean up VS Code. I removed ten extensions and am now with 25 that I use actively, more or less.
The best extensions blend in so well that you'll be surprised that VS Code doesn't offer certain functionality natively. It's the ones "fixing" the editor that stand out!
And I have a hunch that "Better Folding" created by Mohammad Baqer will be one of them. Let me quickly share three extensions I forgot I installed but don't want to miss.
The newbie first: Better Folding

The Better Folding extension was released in 2023 and only has a few downloads yet, but after looking at it, I immediately realized that code folding in VS Code could be better.
VS Code's folding is somehow standing in my way, and that's why I'm not using it that often...
Check out "Better Folding's" improvements!
Everything's nicely configurable, too! I bet VS Code will adopt all these folding features when the extension takes off!
HTML End Tag Labels

And speaking of code folding: to navigate nested HTML structures, I used to collapse certain areas to keep an overview. The HTML End Tag Labels extension makes HTML editing so much easier.
Better Comments

And if a code base comes with lots of comments, Better Comments' TODO highlighting makes it easier to grasp what's essential!
That's all for today's VS Code spring cleaning. If you use extensions that blend in as nicely as these three, shoot them my way!

Code Coverage for Go Integration Tests — While Go has had coverage support at the package test level for almost ten years, coverage for integration tests run outside of the go test mechanism has been non-existent.

The lesson: Cool URIs don't change. And I've just read an article by Tim Berners-Lee (the inventor of the World Wide Web) written in 1998.
That was fifteen years ago, and yet it holds much wisdom.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We were discussing version numbers at work the other day, and, as always, things are complicated. How do you version a beta release? Should projects start with 1.0.0, 0.1.0 or 0.0.1? And do you follow proper semantic versioning or not?
I don't hold strong opinions here, but I do care about setting expectations appropriately. When I update a dependency, I'd like to know if there are expected breaking changes or if it's supposed to be a smooth ride.
The idea of a breaking change is by itself very complicated. Let's say there's a bug in your software; when people already use your code there's a slight chance that a bug fix could also be a breaking change.
But I'll leave this topic for another day...

Yeah... I had to skip a week with Web Weekly. 😢 The last two weeks were just way too busy. Busy but good because I've become a Google Developer Expert. Yay! It's so cool to connect and learn from all these smart people in the program. I'll keep you posted about it!

        <link href="https://www.stefanjudis.com/today-i-learned/how-to-safely-remove-untracked-files-from-git-repos/"/>
        <updated>2023-03-03T23:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The great thing about Git is that almost all actions are reversible! But there's one command that isn't, and it can cause real headaches — git clean.
# remove all untracked files
git clean .

The clean command removes untracked files from your Git working tree, and while that's sometimes exactly what you want, you should really run the command with caution.
You're probably frustrated when you want to start over, but you should be sure you want to throw away everything. Some files might still be valuable. If you run git clean, they're gone — end of story.
By default, Git will not allow you to clean up a repository unless you have clean.requireForce set to false. But you know how it is: an innocent -f is quickly added.
I learned today that git clean (and other commands) support a --dry-run option.
git clean --dry-run .
Would remove not-important.js
Would remove untracked-but-very-important.js

If you want a shorter command line option, use the very intuitive (not!) -n argument.
git clean -n .
Would remove not-important.js
Would remove untracked-but-very-important.js

The command prints out what it would remove without doing any damage. Handy! It also comes with a useful interactive mode to handle many untracked files.
git clean -i
Would remove the following items:
  not-important.js   untracked-but-very-important.js
  
*** Commands ***
  1: clean   2: filter by pattern   3: select by numbers   4: ask each   5: quit   6: help
What now> 4
Remove not-important.js [y/N]? y
Remove untracked-but-very-important.js [y/N]? N
Removing not-important.js

You can choose between pattern matching or checking each file one by one in the interactive mode. Nice one, Git! 💪
But what about other Git commands? Most of the other dry runs don't seem very exciting to me because, as said, most of the Git operations are reversible. But one that I could see come in handy is a git remote prune dry run to avoid removing remote branches. But that's about it. 🤷‍♂️

Opting In to Transparent Telemetry in Go — A debate around adding telemetry to the Go toolchain has been rolling for the past few weeks. Now there’s a new development: “By far the most common suggestion was to make the system opt-in (default off) instead of opt-out (default on). I have revised the design to do that.” There are some downsides to that, of course.

All the answers and much more are included in this week's Web Weekly. 😊
Last week started with a real banger: container size queries (@container) landed in Firefox on valentines day. What a nice surprise: we love you, too, Mozilla. ♥️
All three main engines support container queries now. Unfortunately, it might take a while until Samsung Internet catches up because their Chromium updates are always behind. But hey — very soon, the new era of CSS components begins!
But what about the other huge platform feature that will change how we build for the web — :has()? Well... We don't know when the :has() pseudo-class will be ready. Firefox ships it behin…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yoav Kadosh shared a very useGlobalState React hook.
const store = {};
const listeners = {};

function useGlobalState(key, initialValue) {
  const [state, _setState] = useState(store[key] || initialValue);
  const setState = useCallback((stateOrSetter) => {
    let next = stateOrSetter;
    if (typeof stateOrSetter === "function") {
      next = stateOrSetter(store[key]);
    }

    listeners[key].forEach((l) => l(next));
    store[key] = next;
  }, []);
  useEffect(() => {
    // Store the initial state on the first call with this key
    if (!store[key]) {
      store[key] = initialValue;
    }
    // Create an empty array of listener on the first call with this key
    if (!listeners[key]) {
      listeners[key] = [];
    }
    // Register the observer
    const listener = (state) => _setState(state);
    listeners[key].push(listener);
    // Cleanup when unmounting
    return () => {
      const index = listeners[key].indexOf(listener);
      listeners[key].splice(index, 1);
    };
  }, []);
  return [state, setState];
}

You can then use the defined useGlobalState hook to share or update application state across components. 💪
const [state, setState] = useGlobalState('someUniqueKey', INITIAL_STATE);

Are there downsides to this pattern? I don't know, and I'm a little puzzled why I haven't seen this userland hook before, but if you think useGlobalState is a bad idea, let me know!
If you want to learn more, Yoav explains how it works on his blog!

Purego: A Dynamic Way to Call C Functions from Go Without Cgo — No C means you can build for other platforms easily without a target C compiler/toolchain. No wrapper functions either. One of the contributors noted on HN: "It uses the same mechanisms that Cgo does to switch to the system stack and then call the C code. Purego just avoids having to need a C toolchain to cross compile code that calls into C from Go."
