If you're using Gmail and Chrome, privacy's a lost cause anyways, but let's not get into this topic.
Now, even though I use Gmail, I prefer to sign in with Email/Password combinations and let my password manager do its magic. And with this setup, I don't need yet another modal begging for attention. ðŸ‘‡
Thanks to Ricky Mondello, today I learned you can disable Google's Sign-In nudges in your account settings!
Thank goodness â€” less pop-ups are more fun!

width becomes inline-size, margin-inline is a shorthand for margin-left and margin-right, you get the idea.
MDN lists all the logical CSS properties if you haven't heard about them yet.
That's all good and dandy, but there's at least one situation where logical CSS properties aren't enough. Suppose you want to style a container and make it 50% of the viewport on the horizontal axis.
You can define inline-size: 50vw; but isn't that mixing things up? inline-size will define either the horizontal or vertical size depending on the writing mode, but 50vw will always be the viewport width.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Did Chris just publish a post and unveil the solution to a long-lasting CSS problem almost in a side sentence? It seems like it!
What of the many are we walking about? We're talking about animating an element's height from 0 to something (auto).
Animated grid rows

Not too long ago, browsers shipped animatable CSS grid columns and rows which you could use to fly in a side menu or do fancy stuff like Michelle Barker. ðŸ‘‡
 by Michelle Barker (@michellebarker)
  on CodePen.

I've never considered using animated grid rows to hide grid cells, though.
Here's the trick to toggle an element's height:
define a grid element
define a single grid row with 0fr
add a transition for grid-template-rows
set overflow: hidden to the one element inside the grid
redefine the grid-template-rows to be 1fr with an open class
.grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-rows: 0fr;
  transition: grid-template-rows 0.5s ease-in-out;
}

.grid.open {
  grid-template-rows: 1fr;
}

.grid-inner {
  overflow: hidden;
}

And voila! You can now transition an element's height, and it doesn't use any hardcoded values â€“ toggle a class and call it a day! CSS Grid figures out all the rest.
[Interactive component: visit the article to see it...]
I'm blown away by this!
And sure, to Chris' point, it'd be nice to have an easier way to animate element heights, but I'll take this approach for now! Thanks Chris! ðŸ’¯

        <link href="https://www.stefanjudis.com/blog/how-to-use-raycast-snippet-auto-expansion/"/>
        <updated>2022-12-18T23:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I plugged that I use Raycast for automatic snippet expansion in my weekly newsletter. If you don't know Raycast, it's a macOS Spotlight replacement and the OS-level command bar is very good!
I use Raycast primarily to navigate all the apps on my machine, place windows on different monitors and expand snippets. ;es for example, expands automatically to my email address. Whether in my browser, mail app or Slack, my email address or often used phrases are automagically expanded to save some keystrokes.
But I must admit, the docs on auto-expansion could be better, and someone asked me how I set this functionality up. So here we go!
The native snippet extension

Raycast comes with a native snippet extension to create and search all your snippets from within Raycast itself.
I'm not using it to search my snippets, because I primarily auto-expand things. And to enable auto-expansion, you must look at the overall snippet configuration.
"Enable Snippet Expansion" is the magic trick. After you enable this setting, use the "Create Snippet" or "Edit snippet" command via the Raycast command bar and define a name, the expansion and the character combination triggering it (Keyword).
And that's it!
