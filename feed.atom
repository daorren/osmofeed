It's Web Weekly time and a special welcome to the 18 new subscribers! I'm super excited to have you around! 👋
Today you'll learn about:
mistakes when writing async JavaScript
the inert HTML attribute
the :has() CSS selector
... and, as always, GitHub repositories, a new Tiny Helper and some music.
On a personal note

Last week I said that I wanted to switch to sending this newsletter with an automated schedule. It should hit your inbox Mondays at 8 AM CET.

Martin pointed out that the feature isn't rolled out for everybody at the time of writing this post.
To be honest, I don't need all these text formating options because I'm used to pressing CMD + b and its friends, but being able to control headlines with a few leading # characters is very welcome! 👏

Do you want them to interact with inputs while this question hangs around? Most likely not.
But how do you prevent people from doing precisely this? Covering the page with a faded-in semi-transparent div won't cut it because it's still possible to tab around and focus other areas and elements on the page using the keyboard. Folks using assistive technology might miss the dialog and navigate away, not realizing that their account is up for deletion.
The dialog element is soon cross-browser supported and can help with modal focus handling.

Twitter changed how its library widgets.js handles deleted Tweets embedded on other sites. I never considered this interesting case. How would one build a UI library for data that's not available anymore?
I'd have to sleep over this problem, but here's what I wouldn't do, aka the new Twitter way. 🤦‍♂️
Twitter decided that it's reasonable to wipe out embedded Tweet content on millions of sites if the Tweet in question isn't available on their platform anymore. 😲
Kevin Marks shares this discovery in detail on his blog. Here's a quick summary for my archive.

You might have noticed I skipped last week's Web Weekly. Sitting in between moving boxes got me. Every box I unpacked just made more mess! But I'm almost done moving into my new place... 🤞
I'll also switch to scheduled sending starting next week. Web Weekly will hit your inbox around 8 AM CET every Monday from now on! 🎉
And lastly, welcome to the 54 new subscribers since the last edition! I'm super excited to have you around! 👋
And with this, today you'll learn about:
many unknown HTML tricks (there's some good stuff in this edition)
CSS layouts
messy keyboard JavaScript events
... and, as always, GitHub repositories, a new Tiny Helper and some music.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a tab hoarder. There you have it! I often discover resources and keep their browser tabs open for months. They might come in handy in the future, right?
Today I'm cleaning up my browser tabs, putting things into my bookmarking system, my blog. So, here are some handy image APIs to generate random user avatars.
DiceBear avatars





          
            
DiceBear provides many hash-dependent avatars. Every URL hash (a user id or name) generates a new avatar image.
The service offers many different avatar style options, too.
And they'll get bonus points for serving SVGs! 💯
[Interactive component: visit the article to see it...]
RoboHash




          
            
RoboHash provides hash-dependent avatars, too. They're not serving SVGs but PNGs. Nevertheless, I'm super into the Futurama style!
[Interactive component: visit the article to see it...]
LOREM.SPACE





          
            
LOREM.SPACE offers more than avatar images. They provide movie and music album covers, pizzas, watches and random face pictures. It's a valuable service if you're building a shop or something!
The service doesn't generate images but redirects you to a different URL when calling their endpoints.
They receive bonus points for their built-in image resize options!
[Interactive component: visit the article to see it...]
Conclusion

I just love that we have all these random APIs available these days! 💙
I'll try to extend this post in the future. If you know of more avatar APIs, shoot them my way.

Today I learned that progress HTML elements are considered to be in an indeterminate state if you don't define a element value.

Why's that interesting? Indeterminate elements can be selected with the :indeterminate pseudo-class. 😲 (yeah, I haven't seen that one before either).

Today's Web Weekly is the sixtieth edition. 😊 It's wild that this tiny newsletter has been with me for over a year now. Thanks for reading along!
This time Web Weekly includes:
a guide to networking at developer events
the security problems in the npm ecosystem
the difference between onchange and onChange
... and, as always, GitHub repositories, a new Tiny Helper and some music.
On a personal note

Today I'm entering my last week working for Contentful. It's been fabulous two years. I learned so much about management and leadership. But now, after a month-long break, I'll start my next adventure. Watch the space!
And because the situation in Europe didn't get any better. If you can, please consider offering help or donating money to the folks in Ukraine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today I learned there's a CSS property to align the last line of a rendered paragraph – text-align-last. 😲
Initially, I couldn't see the value of this property because the last paragraph line always follows the overall text-align property. If your text is left-aligned, the last line is left-aligned, too. The same applies to center and right.
So, what's the deal?
A use case for text-align-last

After researching the topic, I discovered that the property can be helpful with text-align: justify. As discussed in a Tailwind issue, you can't style justified paragraphs and control the alignment of the last line. For example, a layout like the one below is not possible without an additional CSS property.

The Go Weekly Newsletter




  





    
Go 1.18 Released
Given the extra excitement around Go 1.18 recently, it's hard to believe Go 1.17 was only released seven months ago! 1.18 is a big enough release that rather than  link solely to the main release announcement, we want to cover a variety of things you might find useful:
The official release post is a good place to start – the headline features of generics, fuzz testing, and workspaces are mentioned, but without going into details.
The official Go 1.18 release notes cover the technicalities of the release at a high level in bulletpoint fashion.

npm's rich ecosystem plays a substantial role in web development. There's a package for literally everything. And even though npm provides scoped packages these days (@stefanjudis/a-package), it's still common to release a package with a simple name.
npm is the wild wild west in this regard. Did you find a free package name? Great! Take it and do whatever you like with it.
But what's a valid package name in the first place?
Valid npm package names

Of course, npm provides an npm package to answer this question – validate-npm-package-name. Use it in your Node.js scripts to evaluate if a package name would be valid on the npm registry. The project repository also lists req…]]></summary>
