Rightfully, one of the main Core Web Vitals is Largest Contentful Paint which measures when elements are rendered and become visible on screen. But how hard could it be to render things quickly?
When it's coming to render time, it's critical to consider what resources you load and how you load them. Render-blocking resources are a primary reason for slow and delayed rendering. Stylesheets and synchronous scripts are the most common offenders.
Unfortunately, there hasn't been a straightforward way to discover render-blocking resources. And even though you could always rely on tools such as ct.css to find problematic resources, these tools r…]]></summary>

What's New in Go's Runtime: Four Years Later — It’s always fantastic to get a roundup from the core Go team on their progress, and while Go 1.13 through 1.18 have certainly seen their fair share of enhancements, we also get to learn a bit more about Go 1.19’s memory limit feature and improved garbage collection. Some highlights from the past few years:


Big efficiency gains on multicore systems.
Go's scheduler spends up to 30% less CPU time spinning.
Go's GC limits its CPU use when the app is idle, reducing CPU spikes.
defer-red function calls now cost as little as regular function calls (mostly).
More efficient timer management.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just discovered the OpenInCode app. I'm not sure yet if I'll really use it, but I like the idea of a having a quick way to open a directory in VS Code with a single click.
The app is a little outdated and wonky but it works.
First, the documenation is outdated: to install the app, use the following brew command.
brew install --cask open-in-code

Follow the README instructions and you're good to go. There's a little issue with macOS dark mode but I can live with this.
Let's see if I'll use it. 😉

Wails v2: Build Cross-Platform Desktop Apps with Go — A big step forward for a project that has shown a lot of promise in recent years. Wails is an Electron-a-like for Go for building cross-platform desktop apps using Go as the base language and JavaScript on the front (and, yes, JS can call your Go functions). v2 introduces a lot of improvements:
    


Svelte, Vue, (P)React, Lit and vanilla JS templates.
Native window translucency effects.
NSIS installer generation for Windows.
Code obfuscation and binary compression support.
No extra libraries or DLLs to ship.

Today I discovered yet another surprise — custom properties don't work in combination with the url() function. 😲
.something {
  /* this doesn't work */
  --image: "https://jo.com/image.jpg";
  background: url(var(--image));
}

Roman Dvornov describes the details quite well in a GitHub issue, but let me give you a condensed explanation.
The two modes of url()

Your url()-containing CSS will be parsed differently, depending on how you use url(). There's an old and a newer way:
Old: url(https://jo.com/image.jpg)
Newer: url('https://jo.com/image.jpg') or url("https://jo.com/image.jpg")

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You might have been in situations where you received a classical three-column blog layout design. Unfortunately, all three columns close off with a "Read more" link. These links aren't good for accessibility because "Read more" isn't very descriptive.
Especially when a page includes multiple links with the same name, navigating them is a challenge. How should one know where all these "Read more" links lead to?
Easy-peasy, aria-label then helps to provide a more accessible name. Right?
<a href="/wonders" aria-label="Wonders of the world">Read more</a>

Thanks to aria-label, screen readers provide more valuable information, even when elements look visually the same.
But today I learned that aria-label can also lead to issues with speech recognition tools when it doesn't match what's visible.
Visitors navigating the web with their voice can tell the software to click an element based on what they see — "Click Read more". An aria-label that overwrites an element's accessible name breaks this functionality.
Ashlee M. Boyer recommends in her article Don’t Overwrite Visual Labels With aria-label to include the visual label if you're improving it via aria-label.
<a href="/something" aria-label="Read more: Wonders of the world">Read more</a>

That's good to know, but the general rule of ARIA remains: Use native and semantically correct elements whenever possible and only use ARIA when you really have to.
So it might be better to get rid of all these "Read more" links in the first place.

Let's Discuss Backward Compatibility in Go — When Russ Cox starts a discussion, we listen. Rather than focus on a new feature, he reflects on Go 1’s compatibility promise (that you’ll be able to compile older Go programs on future versions) and areas where it fails or falls short. It's dry, but important stuff to understand, particularly if you need to maintain Go projects over time.

Concurrency Isn’t Always Faster in Go — The author of 100 Go Mistakes and How to Avoid Them digs into mistake 56 (of the 100!) with a look at the assumption that doing something concurrently must be faster than sequentially. Unsurprisingly, it’s complicated..

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've had many discussions with folks bothered by focus outlines on link and button clicks. "Can we remove these click lines?" was a sentence I often heard. But, at the time, the :focus pseudo-class was the only thing we had, and removing focus outlines entirely would break keyboard accessibility. So we had to push back and fight for proper focus outlines!
Luckily, the :focus-visible pseudo-class helped out. Using :focus-visible, you could only show outlines when a person navigated links and buttons via the keyboard. Win-win! 💪
But then, a tricky transition period started. How should we work around browsers that don't support the pseudo-class yet? There are two ways.
