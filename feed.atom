        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Guten Tag, friends! 👋

If you're subscribed to this newsletter for a while, you know that I discovered the electro piano duo Grandbrothers and became a big fan. I saw them live this week, and I'm so happy; live music is just the best!
Before jumping into nerdy stuff, let's start the week with some doggo cuteness.


          
            
This week's Web Weekly includes:
Fancy CSS features: accent-color, font-family: system-ui and color-scheme
workplace privileges
directory-dependent git configuration
... and, as always, GitHub repositories, a new Tiny Helper and some music.
Ready? Steady. Go!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just came across Marcus Crane's post Conditionally setting your gitconfig. Marcus explains how to use conditional includes and apply directory dependent git configuration.
Here's an example from his blog post:
[user]
  email = user@example.com
  name = User
  signingkey = ABC123
[commit]
  gpgSign = true
[includeIf "gitdir:~/work/"]
  path = ~/.work.gitconfig

The git docs describe that you include configs depending on branch name, too.
I don't need different git configurations these days, but it's good to know this feature exists. 👏

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When writing Node.js automation/build scripts, I occasionally need "sleep" functionality to wait for other tasks to finish. It's not great to implement "sleeps and waits", but sometimes there's no other way than waiting for another system to finish what it's doing.
I often use the following snippet in a Node.js module script. 👇
FYI: Node.js modules support top-level await.
// File: index.mjs

const sleep = (time) => {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(resolve, time);
  });
}

// do something
await sleep(5000);
// do something else

There's nothing particularly wrong with this approach, but I'm very pleased to see that promises-based timer functions are available in Node.js 16 via timers/promises now.
// File: index.mjs

import {
  setTimeout,
} from 'timers/promises';

// do something
await setTimeout(5000);
// do something else

Less code is always better code! 👏

If you want to learn more about AVIF, Jake Archibald has you covered. 😉
I haven't played much with the new image format yet, but it's supposed to lead to smaller files than webp and jpeg. That's great news – a faster web is a better web. You can use the picture element, let the browser load the best and newest image format, and call it a day. Win-win!
But Apple decided not to ship AVIF in Safari because the image format is not supported in their operating systems yet.
Why would one disable features that make websites faster?

I'm a little late with this newsletter this week because I spent my weekend on a boat, in a beer garden and in a Karaoke bar. And all that led to a very slow Sunday. 🙈
Other than that, I'm participating in leadership coaching right now, and last week I learned about a new approach to decision-making. My coach and I discussed three ways/lenses to look at conflicts, decisions and the world.
The reverse lens: “What would the other person in this conflict say?"
The long lens: "How will I look at this problem in six months?"
The wide lens: "How can I learn and grow from the situation?"
I really like this approach of considering "the bigger picture" and will try to use it going forward. Let's make less hot-headed and short-sighted decisions!

        <updated>2021-08-07T22:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today I discovered an exciting section in the CSS media queries Level 5 spec. The custom media queries section explains how to define and reuse aliases for media queries. Why would you need that?
Well... if you're using CSS custom properties and wanted to use them in a media query, you probably discovered that you can't use custom properties in this context. CSS custom properties weren't designed for that use case. Bummer!
:root {
  --width: 20em;
}

/* that doesn't work :/ */
@media (min-width: var(--width)) {
}


You could now rely on tools such as Sass and introduce another non-native variable system to clean up your media queries, but yeah... this approach is not great!
But here's the solution – say hello to custom media queries!
@custom-media --narrow-window (max-width: 30em);

@media (--narrow-window) {
  /* narrow window styles */
}

Isn't this beautiful? I think many web developers are waiting for that for quite some time. But here's the sad news: you can't use custom media queries today because it's only future music.
I googled around for a few minutes, and apparently, custom media queries are in the spec for years. There doesn't seem to be much interest in implementing it, though. Neither MDN nor caniuse.com knows about the feature. :/
If you want to use it today, leverage PostCSS and the Custom Media plugin. That's better than nothing, but hey... can we have custom media queries, please?
Edits and comments


Adam Argyle filed a Chromium feature request for it now. 🎉 You can give your vote here.
Marco Biedermann pointed out that custom media queries are part of the postcss-present-env stage 1.

Buna ziua, friends!
It's the 30th Web Weekly today, and this newsletter also passed 1500 subscribers. 🎉 Thank you for reading along and replying to the newsletter with resources and feedback. 💙
Before we jump into web stuff, let me share some "typo stickers" that made me smile this week.




          
            
This week's Web Weekly includes:
predictable scrollbar spacing
the order of CSS transformations
the state of Safari
... and, as always, GitHub repositories, a new Tiny Helper and some music.
Ready? Steady. Go!
Safari's current state – it's complicated

Let's take the prefers-reduced-motion media query as an example.👇
@media screen and (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  /* stop all these animations */
}

You can use the prefers-reduced-motion query to stop animating elements when users prefer not to see motion and animations (learn more about why you should do that on CSS-Tricks). The query can have two different values: no-preference and reduce.
If you have used this media query before, you might know that you can also use its short variant and drop the reduce value. The media query will behave the same.

        <link href="https://www.stefanjudis.com/snippets/how-to-extract-text-from-an-image-via-the-cli/"/>
        <updated>2021-08-01T19:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I came across a post by Simon Willison that described how to use the tesseract CLI command to extract text from an image. I took the opportunity to fiddle around with some shell scripting and added an extract-text-from-image command to my dotfiles. It uses tesseract to analyze an image, creates a txt file with the embedded text, copies the ebedded text to the clipboard, and deletes the txt file again.
The tesseract command was available on my machine. If it's not available on yours, install it via your favorite package manager.
Find extract-image-from-texts last iteration below:
function extract-text-from-image() {
  if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Please specify the file you want to scan.";
    echo "  -> extract-text-from-image /some/path/image.png";
    return 1;
  fi

  TARGET_DIR=$(dirname "$1");
  FILENAME=$(basename -- "$1");
  FILENAME_WITHOUT_EXTENSION="${FILENAME%.*}";

  tesseract "$1" "$TARGET_DIR/$FILENAME_WITHOUT_EXTENSION" -l eng txt || return 1;
  pbcopy < "$TARGET_DIR/$FILENAME_WITHOUT_EXTENSION.txt";
  rm "$TARGET_DIR/$FILENAME_WITHOUT_EXTENSION.txt";
  echo "🎉 Text copied to clipboard!";
}

I don't think I'll use this command daily, but I'm amazed by this piece of CLI magic.
Edit: Wesley Martin shared the macOCR project with me and it's also worth a look!
