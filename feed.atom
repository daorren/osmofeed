Perfectly Reproducible, Verified Go Toolchains — Go 1.21 contains some significant features, but truly reproducible builds is a big deal and Russ goes (deep) into how it works here, complete with a walkthrough. The Go team has also built a tool, gorebuild, to prove the feature works as intended.
Russ Cox 


  
  
Cgo Performance in Go 1.21 — Cgo makes it possible for Go packages to call C code and is commonly used to provide Go apps with access to the larger world of C-based libraries. Shane doesn’t want to argue about Cgo's pros and cons here but does make the case that its performance is good and the overhead is insignificant in most cases.

I took a little time to respond (thanks for the async expectations, email!) and wrote back what I hoped was an equally thoughtful, and hopefully helpful, response.
But then nothing.
To be fair, there were no action items. No lingering questions. No big obvious reason that another reply was needed.
It just felt off.
I run into this feeling all the time, and it isn't limited to email conversations.
Whether it's Slack, email, Twitter replies (or literally any text communication), many conversations just die. There's no "thank you!" or "talk later!" to wrap things up. Apparently, it's okay to just move the human interaction off the todo list.
No action item? Cool, no response!

Go Weekly




  





  
  
On Backward Compatibility, Go 1.21, and.. Go 2? — If backwards compatibility sounds boring, “boring can be good,” says Russ, who has written about some of the “important work we shipped in Go 1.21 to keep Go boring” when it comes to ensuring your programs continue to compile in the face of changes to Go’s tooling.

When will we be able to animate the display property? What's CSS @starting-style? And when will the HTML search element hit the baseline?
This week's Web Weekly includes all the answers and much more. Enjoy!
Artur Bień described how to use SVG filters to mask out a DOM element's black pixels. Wild!
The filter uses feColorMatrix, and oh boy... I've no idea how this works. 😅
But SVG filters aren't only about masking out pixels. My favorite SVG filter use case is making components naturally reflect their colors.
And then there's fancy stuff, like Robin Rendle's SVG noise filter animation.
The filter's rough and artsy. I love it!
I doubt I'll start creating these wild effects myself soon, but I started collecting beautiful SVG filter examples. Do you know any more fancy filters…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The CSS filter property provides two hands full of handy filters.
filter: blur(5px);
filter: brightness(0.4);
filter: contrast(200%);
filter: drop-shadow(16px 16px 20px blue);
filter: grayscale(50%);
...

And that's cool, but filter really shines when you apply custom SVG filters with the url() function.
filter: url("filters.svg#filter-id");

SVG is such a secret powerhouse for creating custom filters. This post is my SVG filter bookmark, which I'll extend over time.
An SVG filter to cut out black pixels

Artur Bień's post "Using HTML elements as CSS masks" triggered this post because he shared a very fancy SVG filter to mask out black pixels.
[Interactive component: visit the article to see it...]
If you play around with it, you'll discover that it only masks "real black" pixels. Still — it's a wild filter!
A natural shadow SVG filter

I love a good box-shadow, but one problem with CSS shadows is that they only displays a single color. Wouldn't it be nice if you could create shadows that pick up a DOM elements color?
Guess what? SVG can do natural lighting shadows, too!
[Interactive component: visit the article to see it...]
Unfortunately, it looks like Safari still has issues with this filter, but hey... the world won't go down if Safari users won't see a colorful shadow. 🤷‍♂️

      
        
          
        
      
      
A fancy noise / dither SVG filter

I found this effect on Robin Rendle's blog, and I love the rough and artsy feeling of added SVG noise.
[Interactive component: visit the article to see it...]
Note that this effect combines three SVG filters that are rotated via a @keyframes animation.

If you have other SVG in your toolbox, shoot them my way! I'd love to extend this list!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Removing event listeners from DOM elements is pretty annoying because you must have the registered event handler function at hand.
function handleEvent() { /* ... */ }

// add an event listener
document.querySelector('button')
  .addEventListener('click', handleEvent);

// to remove an event listener, the event type ('click') 
// and the function ('handleEvent') have to match 
// the `addEventListener` call
document.querySelector('button')
  .removeEventListener('click', handleEvent);

With somewhat modern JavaScript, you could also use AbortSignals or the once config option to remove event listeners, but what if it isn't your source code that's adding event listeners? What if there's one annoying 3rd party script messing with your events and you have to keep it?
Today I learned about a nuclear option to remove all existing event listeners.
const button = document.querySelector('button);

// replace the element with a copy of itself
// and nuke all the event listeners
button.replaceWith(button.cloneNode(true));

Boom! And that's it — replacing a DOM element with a cloned version of itself removes all previously registered event handlers. Pretty handy!
If you want to see this pattern in action, here we go. 👇
