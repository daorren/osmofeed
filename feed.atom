        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Do you remember Facebook's hugely popular like button? A quick-to-add JS snippet enabled site owners to implement Facebook functionality, and the social media giant started tracking people across the web.
It's been wild times, and luckily, things are different today. People are more privacy aware, (some) browsers started blocking all these trackers, and I stopped using Facebook years ago.
But I do watch many YouTube videos. And this made me think: how does YouTube treat privacy when you embed a video?
I was delighted to learn about YouTube's privacy-enhanced embed mode!
If you turn it on, the iframe source changes from youtube.com/embed/[ID] to youtube-nocookie.com/embed/[ID]. That's pretty cool!
But unfortunately, I just stumbled upon Jason Grigsby's disappointment about the feature.
So what's up?
First, the domain youtube-nocookie.com seemed to have been a cute developer idea until the business decided that dropping all cookies isn't great for the ad monetization model. youtube-nocookie.com does not mean no cookies.
"We won't store user info unless you interact with the embed".
Ouch... but fair; YouTube doesn't hide what they're doing here. youtube-nocookie.com isn't more than an unfortunate domain choice, but hey, we've all bought silly domains at some point, right?
But it's not okay that the explainer claims that the embed only starts storing user info after an interaction.
I just tried it out, and look what I've found in my localstorage. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
So much about, "we won't store user info unless you play the video". Not cool, YouTube. Really not cool!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On my font optimization journey, I've learned that subsetting is an invaluable approach to reducing font file sizes. I've been able to cut down Roboto's size from 785kB to 200kB by subsetting it to ASCII characters. And when going the extreme way, I could even bring it down to 58kB by aggressively limiting the included characters.
But could one squeeze out even more bytes of the Roboto font?
When you inspect Roboto with Wakamai Fondue, you'll discover that it ships 13(!) variable font axes.
That's great, but I wonder if you need all these variable configuration parameters in production and argue that a good design defines only a few font variations. 13 configurable axes shouldn't be needed at all times.
Thanks to Tobias Kunish, I learned you can also remove axes with some tooling! Does the removal of font axes affect the font size? Let's find out!
Slice is an open-source application to create custom font design spaces from variable fonts. Unfortunately, I'm not enough font nerd to understand all of Slice's functionality, but what I get is that you can inspect a font's axes and limit their ranges or define a static value for each.
For example, if you're not interested in including all the variations of the parametric figure height (YTFI), set a value and drop the axis from the font entirely.
To test things out, I kept the opsz, wght, GRAD, wdth and slnt axis untouched and set a fixed value for the eight other axes to remove them from my local Roboto font.
Font
Size with 13 axes
Size with 5 axes




Roboto (all characters & glyphs)
784kB
710kB


Roboto (Latin)
322kB
292kB


Roboto (ASCII)
202kB
182kB


Roboto (only a few characters)
58kB
52kB



And indeed, removing font axes resulted in more saved bytes!
So, if you're on the journey of optimizing your fonts, subsetting will give you massive results, but if you want to go the extra mile, you can also shave off some more bytes by limiting font axis range values or removing axes entirely. Happy optimizing!

By now, 3.5k people get this email every week, which is almost a bit scary.
Thank you for reading along and being part of the Web Weekly crew! üíô
