        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Buna ziua, friends!

In preparation for my new talk "Back to boring" I looked at the Open UI project whose goal is to standardize more UI components.
The idea is simple. If there are components that are included and reinvented in every design system out there, shouldn't these components become HTML elements? Big yes from my side!
And there are good things in the making:
selectmenu will enable us to build styleable select controls finally.
popup will help to show and hide elements on click or keyboard navigation.
focusgroup will make custom controls more accessible.
I can't wait until I can build accessible components like the one below without JavaScript.
The project's still in the early stages, but I'm 100% convinced we need more high-level HTML components. The web evolved, and if 95% of …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This site uses Umami as a self-hosted and privacy-first analytics tool. An item in Umami's changelog caught my eye – "Update tracker/index.js: SendBeacon() to Fetch API".
sendBeacon is a JavaScript method to send requests to an analytics server. These requests are supposed to be async, not be canceled and outlive the current navigation. But apparently, sendBeacon is sometimes blocked by ad blockers.
That's not a big deal, though, because today I learned I can drop sendBeacon from my memory entirely and use the fetch method with a keepalive option. 👇
fetch(`${root}/api/collect`, {
  method: 'POST',
  body: data,
  // note the `keepalive` option
  keepalive: true,
});

fetch with a keepalive option has the same characteristics as sendBeacon and acts as its replacement. This is good to know!
Don't confuse the keepalive fetch attribute with the Keep-Alive HTTP header.

Go has passed 100,000 stars on GitHub. There was no obvious top feature this week, so what better way to celebrate than to mark the (arguably quite arbitrary) milestone of Go passing into the six figure GitHub stars club? I mean, it's twice as many as Ruby on Rails has, and GitHub was built with that.. :-)





  
  
Data Race Patterns in Go — Uber's engineers analyzed over 1,100 data races and found that it’s much easier than you might think to introduce them in Go "due to certain language design choices." This post breaks down seven of the most common reasons – your code probably engages in one of them too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a big fan of prototyping in the JavaScript console and find myself opening the developer tools just for this purpose.
Unfortunately, console prototyping can sometimes be a little cumbersome for extensive snippets because the console isn't built for writing extended snippets spanning multiple lines. You can work around this by pressing Shift + Enter, but still, it's not great.
Today, I was thrilled to learn that the Firefox developer tools provide a somewhat hidden multi-line console editor to write extended snippets more easily!
This feature is top DX in action! 💯 Thanks Firefox.

Quick HTML tip: I just discovered that `li` elements support a `value` attribute to configure the start of an ordered list.

Trending Tweets often come with priceless comments. And it turned out that there are multiple ways to control the numbers of an ordered list.
Let's have a quick look!
Specify the list start using start

Manuel pointed out that the start attribute also allows you to specify the beginning of the unordered list. Ordered lists usually start at 1.
[Interactive component: visit the article to see it...]
This functionality is valuable if your listings are divided by paragraphs and additional information.
Define the list item position using value

As already mentioned; if you want to control the position of a single list item, you can also use the value attribute on a specific list item.
[Interactive component: visit the article to see it...]
This functionality is valuable if you're dealing with rankings and two entries are in the same position.
Bonus: Control list styles via CSS

And for completeness, there are also ways to control the list styles via list-style in CSS.

Read more about list-style on MDN.
If you're going for custom list styles, don't visually change the meaning of your listing to keep your HTML accessible in RSS feeds or assistive technology.

It's so fascinating that HTML still holds surprises for me after writing it for over ten years!

You might have noticed that I took a two-week break from Web Weekly. I just felt too exhausted with too many moving pieces in my life. But everything's on track again! 😊
I started building a proper landing page for this newsletter mainly to play around with Remix. It felt great that I didn't hit any blockers and could get rolling right away. The structure of Remix files reminds me of writing PHP back in the day, though. Is this web development repeating itself with another file extension?
I have a quick ask: do you see the testimonials section? I'd love to include more quotes in it. If you enjoy Web Weekly, it'd be great if you could share it online. Thank you!
And with this, today you'll learn about:

Tim Bray's Go Diaries: Generics — Tim (one of the original co-authors of the XML spec) finds a use case for generics in his Quamima pattern matching library, only to find that there are some ‘bumps in the road’ which he shares here for everyone’s benefit.
Tim concludes: “I don’t hate Go’s generics, which is actually pretty strong testimony given that I spent the best part of a couple of days fighting all the stuff described above. But, my guess is the Go generics story is isn’t finished yet.”

Jim explains why browsers should expose site-specific color scheme preference controls. Imagine you could run your operating system in dark mode (I really like the dark MacOS UI!), your browser in light mode, and still switch particular sites to dark mode.
I'm super into this idea! Read Jim's post if you want to learn more about this color preference cascade. ☝️
The post includes a few things that stand out, though.

Whenever you find yourself cd'ing around in a large project just to reach the root of a git repository, the following alias might come in handy.
alias gr='cd $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)'

It automatically navigates you to the git repo root! 💪
