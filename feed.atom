        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Suppose you're using a password manager (if you don't, go and install one now — the internet is a scary place, and breaches happen all the time); you might have run into situations when your password manager comes up with a nicely cryptic and unique password that'll be rejected by a website because it's too long, uses not allowed characters or other nonsense.
If that happens, you should evaluate if you really want to subscribe somewhere, but it's also poor UX. Wouldn't it be great if there was a declarative way to inform password managers about supported password combinations?
It turns out there is — sort of. If you're in the Apple ecosystem and use the native password management tools, Safari supports a passwordrules HTML attribute to control its password autofill feature. 1Password also seems to pick up the attribute.
<input type="password" 
  passwordrules="minlength: 8; required: lower; required: upper; required: digit; required: [_];">

If you want to play around with passwordrules, Apple provides a tool to generate rules and you can test it out in Safari. The feature worked for simple configurations but enforcing Unicode characters such as ⭐ didn't work for me. 😅
As far as I can tell, there's no proper spec about the HTML attribute yet, but it's up for discussion since 2018 (thanks Dennis Schubert). And while digging deeper (thanks Thomas Broyer), I discovered that passwordrules probably won't go anywhere soon because Mozilla doesn't think it's a good idea.
Let's see how this turns out!
Multiple folks pointed out that passwort restrictions are useless because the only thing protecting against a brutforce attack is password length. I'm no security expert and might do some reading to update the post later.

React finally shipped a working implementation of Server Components in Next.js. I haven't played with them yet, but it seems they involve heavy bundler magic to make them feel like good old PHP.

The Go Developer Survey 2023 Q1 Results — Nearly 6,000 gophers took part in the latest developer survey, and now we have the results. Key takeaways include:


92% of respondents are satisfied using Go.
Error handling is now folks' biggest pain point.
Keeping dependencies up to date (if maintaining a module) is a challenge.
VS Code remains the editor of choice, with GoLand a solid second.
The majority of Go devs work on either a Mac or Linux machine (tied in terms of popularity) but Windows is notably popular with newer devs.

All the answers and much more are included in this week's Web Weekly!
Our friends at Google released a new WebDev term at Google.io — "the baseline". Usually, I'm no fan of new tech lingo (MPA anyone? 😅), but I can get behind this one.
The baseline describes features supported in the current and previous versions of all major browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and  Safari). So that it replaces the mouthful "feature ABC is cross-browser supported".
And the term isn't only a Google effort but a collaboration of Apple, Microsoft, and Mozilla. Get ready because we can expect many new baseline widgets like th…]]></summary>
