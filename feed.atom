When will we be able to animate the display property? What's CSS @starting-style? And when will the HTML search element hit the baseline?
This week's Web Weekly includes all the answers and much more. Enjoy!
Artur Bień described how to use SVG filters to mask out a DOM element's black pixels. Wild!
The filter uses feColorMatrix, and oh boy... I've no idea how this works. 😅
But SVG filters aren't only about masking out pixels. My favorite SVG filter use case is making components naturally reflect their colors.
And then there's fancy stuff, like Robin Rendle's SVG noise filter animation.
The filter's rough and artsy. I love it!
I doubt I'll start creating these wild effects myself soon, but I started collecting beautiful SVG filter examples. Do you know any more fancy filters…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The CSS filter property provides two hands full of handy filters.
filter: blur(5px);
filter: brightness(0.4);
filter: contrast(200%);
filter: drop-shadow(16px 16px 20px blue);
filter: grayscale(50%);
...

And that's cool, but filter really shines when you apply custom SVG filters with the url() function.
filter: url("filters.svg#filter-id");

SVG is such a secret powerhouse for creating custom filters. This post is my SVG filter bookmark, which I'll extend over time.
An SVG filter to cut out black pixels

Artur Bień's post "Using HTML elements as CSS masks" triggered this post because he shared a very fancy SVG filter to mask out black pixels.
[Interactive component: visit the article to see it...]
If you play around with it, you'll discover that it only masks "real black" pixels. Still — it's a wild filter!
A natural shadow SVG filter

I love a good box-shadow, but one problem with CSS shadows is that they only displays a single color. Wouldn't it be nice if you could create shadows that pick up a DOM elements color?
Guess what? SVG can do natural lighting shadows, too!
[Interactive component: visit the article to see it...]
Unfortunately, it looks like Safari still has issues with this filter, but hey... the world won't go down if Safari users won't see a colorful shadow. 🤷‍♂️

      
        
          
        
      
      
A fancy noise / dither SVG filter

I found this effect on Robin Rendle's blog, and I love the rough and artsy feeling of added SVG noise.
[Interactive component: visit the article to see it...]
Note that this effect combines three SVG filters that are rotated via a @keyframes animation.

If you have other SVG in your toolbox, shoot them my way! I'd love to extend this list!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Removing event listeners from DOM elements is pretty annoying because you must have the registered event handler function at hand.
function handleEvent() { /* ... */ }

// add an event listener
document.querySelector('button')
  .addEventListener('click', handleEvent);

// to remove an event listener, the event type ('click') 
// and the function ('handleEvent') have to match 
// the `addEventListener` call
document.querySelector('button')
  .removeEventListener('click', handleEvent);

With somewhat modern JavaScript, you could also use AbortSignals or the once config option to remove event listeners, but what if it isn't your source code that's adding event listeners? What if there's one annoying 3rd party script messing with your events and you have to keep it?
Today I learned about a nuclear option to remove all existing event listeners.
const button = document.querySelector('button);

// replace the element with a copy of itself
// and nuke all the event listeners
button.replaceWith(button.cloneNode(true));

Boom! And that's it — replacing a DOM element with a cloned version of itself removes all previously registered event handlers. Pretty handy!
If you want to see this pattern in action, here we go. 👇

        <link href="https://www.stefanjudis.com/notes/how-to-show-typescript-type-annotations-in-code-snippets/"/>
        <updated>2023-08-09T22:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes, I blog about TypeScript, and I always wondered if it's possible to render type annotations in syntax-highlighted code snippets on this blog.
Previous Google searches didn't help me, so here's another contribution to the internet: I finally found a project that allows rendering type annotations in code snippets.
Say hello to "Shiki Twoslash"

Twoslash allows you to add TypeScript type information to your code snippets. In their words, Twoslash is:
markdown code samples powered by the syntax engine of Visual Studio Code
mixed with the TypeScript compiler’s information.
And that's pretty incredible, because it's also able to validate your code and show possible Typescript errors.
ts

interface Person {
  name: string
}
 
interface Person {
  age: number
}
 
// `Person` is now merged and expects `name` and `age`
const p: Person = {
Property 'name' is missing in type '{ age: number; }' but required in type 'Person'.2741Property 'name' is missing in type '{ age: number; }' but required in type 'Person'.
  age: 99
}


You can let Twoslash do its job; if your snippets aren't correct, it'll complain and error out (unless you tell it that you expect an error like above).
And because it uses the VS Code type checker, it works for JavaScript snippets, too!
js

const a = {
  joo: 'test'
};
 
console.log(a.foo);
Property 'foo' does not exist on type '{ joo: string; }'.2339Property 'foo' does not exist on type '{ joo: string; }'.

And then, you can use some fancy markdown syntax to inspect variables and even show possible auto-completion values.
js

const a = {
  test: 'test'
  testTwo: 'test'
  testThree: 'test'
};
 
console.log(a.te
                
test
testThree
testTwo

 
 
console.log(a);
           
const a: {
    test: string;
    testTwo: string;
    testThree: string;
}


Wild! 🤯
I'm not entirely convinced I'll use Twoslash for every code snippet on the blog, but for TypeScript snippets — heck yeah!

Is this a trick question? Not really.
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
numbers[1] = 'new value';
console.log(numbers); // [1, 'new value', 3, 4, 5]

But when you're using React or any framework betting on immutability, just changing an array entry will lead to subtle bugs because the array will still be the same object with the same reference. In an immutable world, data updates always have to result in a new object reference.
How can you change an array element via its index and spit out a new array in the same go then? A 12-years-old Stack Overflow question with 1.5m views has tons of advice, but because it's so old and has hundreds of upvotes, it's not showing the most modern solution in the top area.

How many units are defined in CSS? Is Jamstack dead? Or how can you detect Emojis in JavaScript strings?
This week's Web Weekly includes all the answers and much more. Enjoy!
Tricky question: what domains do you own? If you own country code top-level domains such as .af (Afghanistan), .io (British Indian Ocean Territory) or .gg ( Bailiwick of Guernsey), here's a reminder to maybe move to a "boring" .com domain instead.
Web Bos and Jason Lengstorf have issues with .af. And I've read plenty of reports from people losing domain access lately.
From friend to friend: you better pick a safe over a fancy domain, you know? 😅
