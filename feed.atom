        <id>https://www.stefanjudis.com/today-i-learned/suffix-aliases-in-zsh/</id>
        <link href="https://www.stefanjudis.com/today-i-learned/suffix-aliases-in-zsh/"/>
        <updated>2022-07-04T22:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I like geeking out on my local shell setup, and my dotfiles hold a few aliases I can't live without – ll, ni, nr and all these other two-character commands are deeply engrained in my muscle memory.
To define an alias, you set a new command name and map it to another command.
alias ll='exa -la --git --icons'

Today I learned that the alias command in Zsh also supports a -s flag which enables suffix aliases. As a result, this is a valid alias in Zsh:
# "Run" the file to look at its content
# $ index.html
# -> cat index.html
alias -s html=cat

You can "just run files" with a suffix alias without defining a command or making it an executable. After defining the alias above, executing index.html on your terminal will be expanded and shuffled to cat index.html. 😲
If you want to learn more about suffix aliases, access its manual via man zshbuiltins on the command line.
But there's more! You can define a suffix alias for multiple file types, too. I added cat (aliased to bat on my machine) as the standard handling of the following file formats.
# "Run" the file to look at its content
# $ ./readme.md
# -> cat ./readme.md
alias -s {js,json,env,md,html,css,toml}=cat

I'm super into this shorter way of looking into text files quickly.
This functionality is pretty neat already, but there's more (even though it might be a bit of a hack). @_smhmd pointed out that they use suffix aliases to save typing git clone when cloning a git repository. They paste the repo SSH link into the terminal, and it's expanded to a proper clone command. Smart! 😲
# "Run" ssh links to clone repos
# $ git@github.com:stefanjudis/dotfiles.git
# -> git clone git@github.com:stefanjudis/dotfiles.git
alias -s git="git clone"

Do you know of more suffix alias use cases? If so, I'd love to hear them via email or on Twitter!

Additionally, Wavebox sits on another monitor to move Gmail, multiple Messengers and all the other always-open websites out of my browser. This approach works, but I wouldn't say that I'm happy with this setup.
But it's not only me. I see a lot of folks fighting the unorganized mess of too many tabs and websites. Did the internet outgrow browsers built to show a handful of websites?

David uses a JavaScript Proxy to map object properties to fetch calls.
This approach works quite nice for querying RESTful APIs. apiObject.cars() maps to /cars/ and apiObject.cars('123') maps to /cars/123/. 👏
// Found at https://gist.github.com/DavidWells/53518b3c12344952641dc81cc7599939
const createApi = (url) => {
  return new Proxy({}, {
    get(target, key) {
      return async function(id = "") {
        const response = await fetch(`${url}/${key}/${id}`)
        if (response.ok) {
          return response.json();
        }
        return Promise.resolve({ error: "Malformed Request" })
      }
    }
  })
}

let api = createApi("https://swapi.co/api")

// 'get' request to https://swapi.co/api/people
let people = await api.people()

// 'get' request to https://swapi.co/api/people/1
let person = await api.people(1)

What a great little trick! 💯

Last week has been the day many poor souls waited for. Internet Explorer 11 left Microsoft's support rotation. No patches and security fixes anymore!
I haven't dealt with IE for ages, but I know folks that still had to tackle it occasionally. But does no support mean the outdated browser will just disappear? As Adrian puts it: "This doesn’t mean that the copy of IE11 on your client’s computer will suddenly uninstall itself." And this is true, but I think now's really the time to forget about it.
If you want to go down memory lane for a moment and see some "great" IE hacks, Pawel collected some nice ones to say goodbye.
And with this, today you'll learn about:
AbortController use cases

Go 1.19 Beta 1 Released — This post on the golang-announce group just has the basics of how to download it, but these draft release notes go further into actual features (which are predominantly fixes and tweaks - don’t expect a big 1.18 style release, though the addition of an optional soft memory limit for the runtime is interesting).

Language Proposal: Bring Direct SIMD Support into Go — Language proposals are always interesting to read, particularly when they provoke discussion; here, a simd library to take advantage of SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) CPU instructions is proposed and has been marked “active” by the core team for now.
