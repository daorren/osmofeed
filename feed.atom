So, how was your week, friends? I had had a super chilled weekend and had some time to polish some styles on my website. The CSS architecture is such a mess; luckily, only I work on it (YOLO!). Apart from that, I'll be on a Contentful webinar next week, and maybe you want to say Hi!
This week's Web Weekly includes:
Resources to level up your VS Code game.
A project that generates videos with React.
Reasons to step into leadership.
... and, as always, GitHub repositories, a new Tiny Helper and some music.
Something that made me smile

But before we jump into the nerdy things, let me show you what made me laugh this week, and let's look at these weirds books that you can order on Amazon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I still define my CSS colors in hex values. 💪 rgb(), rgba(), hsl() and hsla() are valuable CSS functions, but it's so cumbersome to convert hex values (#34aa44) to numbers or percentages. That's why I never adopted the color functions.
The spec even includes a section explaining how to convert RGB to HSL and vice versa.
My rare usage is why I missed that the CSS Color Module Level 4 spec made rgba() and hsla() redundant.
The specification introduced two changes:
rgb()/hsl() accept alpha values.
Color functions accept space-separared values.
With rgb()/hsl() accepting transparency values, hsla() and rgba() became legacy functions and are now aliases for rgb()/hsl().
If you worry about browser support, check MDN. rgb()/hsl() transparency values are well supported!
The second edition is a new space-separated syntax, that improves readability:
/* evolution of the rgb function with transparency */
rgba(255, 255, 255, 50%)
rgba(255 255 255 / 50%)
rgb(255 255 255 / 50%)

/* evolution of the hsl function with transparency */

These two new features made color handling easier! You don't have to worry about color functions that do or don't support transparency, and the space/slash syntax highlights seperates values and makes it easier to read. I love it when CSS becomes more precise!

Do you know these beautiful coding themes with fancy-looking cursive fonts? 👇



          
            
I was always jealous of people using them, and today I spent some time figuring out how that works.
A font with cursive characters and a theme using italics

You need two things to enable a cursive font in your editor:
a coding theme that leverages italics for particular tokens (not many do)
a font that is primarily monospaced but includes cursive characters for italics
My VS Code setup consists of the Yi light/dark coding theme and the FiraCode editor font. And, unfortunately, Yi doesn't use italics and FireCode doesn't include cursive charact…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today I learned that the color theme I use (Yi color theme) does not support semantic syntax highlighting. Semantic what?
Semantic syntax highlighting makes sure your source code is not only beautifully colored, but that used the colors are logical, too.
After learning about this feature, I discovered that my editor's syntax highlighting is very confusing. Functions, methods, arguments and parameters change their color from line to line. I wonder how I never noticed this chaos!
But thanks to VS Code, you can enforce semantic highlighting using the editor.semanticHighlighting.enabled setting (read more in the VS Code docs) so that syntactic tokens don't change colors constantly! 🎉

          
            
I turned it on for now. Let's find out if code is easier to grasp or if my brain needs unlogical always changing colors. 🤷‍♂️

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're a tab hoarder like me, you probably noticed that browsers discard inactive browser tabs to save resources eventually. The tabs are still open and visible in the browser UI but are put to sleep and only brought back and reloaded on tab focus.
Today I found out that there are ways to control if tabs should be discarded and even discard tabs yourself.
In Chrome/Edge navigate to about://discards (about is a shorthand to use the same protocol in Chrome and Edge and find all open tabs ready to be controlled.




          
            
All tab entries include an Urgent Discard button to put them to sleep, and you can configure if a particular tab should be auto-discardable, too.
Similar functionality will be included in Firefox 94 at about:unloads. The page provides insights into the allocated tab resources and allows you to "unload" them one at a time. What's different here is that you can't decide which tabs to unload because the "unload" button only discards tabs in a prioritized order. 🤷‍♂️



          
            
All in all, tab discarding is a handy functionality, and I'll try out discarding all tabs the next time I'm running low on memory or battery. (I can't lose all the tabs...)
But configuring "auto discard" for each tab, I won't mess with it. Browsers don't discard active tabs like a YouTube music video or the Slack UI, and they're probably smarter at figuring out when an active tab consumes too many resources than I am. 😉

        <link href="https://www.stefanjudis.com/snippets/how-to-configure-vs-code-bracket-colors/"/>
        <updated>2021-09-07T22:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bracket Colorization became a native VS Code feature with the August 2021 update, and it replaces the popular Bracket Pair Colorizer extension. The reason behind the new native functionality is that the extension suffered from bad performance when colorizing large files (I never noticed that, but hey... 🤷‍♂️).





          
            
When I went to my VS Code settings to enable the feature, I couldn't figure out how to configure the bracket colors to match my color theme. Unfortunately, the setting description was not very helpful because it doesn't tell what to put into workbench.colorCustomizations.




          
            
Luckily, I found a tweet by Rachel Leggett that describes how to configure the colors using the editorBracketHighlight.foreground keys.
So here we go with something to copy and paste into your settings.json.
{
  "editor.bracketPairColorization.enabled": true,
  "workbench.colorCustomizations": {
    "editorBracketHighlight.foreground1": "#5caeef",
    "editorBracketHighlight.foreground2": "#dfb976",
    "editorBracketHighlight.foreground3": "#c172d9",
    "editorBracketHighlight.foreground4": "#4fb1bc",
    "editorBracketHighlight.foreground5": "#97c26c",
    "editorBracketHighlight.foreground6": "#abb2c0",
    "editorBracketHighlight.unexpectedBracket.foreground": "#db6165"
  },

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Adrian Roselli shared that Chrome and Edge provide highly visible focus outlines.
Go to their accessibility settings pages to turn on the feature:
Chrome: chrome://settings/accessibility
Edge starting with v94: edge://settings/accessibility


          
            
When turned on, you see that focused elements receive an additional border and box-shadow.




          
            
I haven't decided yet if I keep highly visible focus outlines turned on in Chrome/Edge, but I'd wish Firefox would offer a similar feature or improve their focus outlines at some point.
(the tiny dotted line bugs me for years by now 🙈)
Edit: Šime pointed out that you can change Firefox' focus outline by navigating to about:config and changing browser.display.focus_ring_style to 0 and browser.display.focus_ring_width to 4. 👏

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While reading an article about "unknown" Netlify CLI features, I discovered a little developer experience gem.
When you run netlify dev, netlify will check if there’s an open browser tab on the existing port and if so, it’ll re use that tab to display your project as opposed to spinning up a new tab every time.
As a tab hoarder, I appreciate it when development tools reuse and focus already open localhost tabs. Unfortunately, I can't remember that I've ever seen a development CLI command reusing/focusing an already open tab.
How does that work? Is there an easy way to do that programmatically? And why did I never notice this?
An npm package to reuse tabs – better-opn

I analyzed what the Netlify CLI does and discovered that it uses the better-opn npm package (find the usage here). The code…]]></summary>

If you're subscribed to this newsletter for a while, you know that I discovered the electro piano duo Grandbrothers and became a big fan. I saw them live this week, and I'm so happy; live music is just the best!
Before jumping into nerdy stuff, let's start the week with some doggo cuteness.


          
            
This week's Web Weekly includes:
Fancy CSS features: accent-color, font-family: system-ui and color-scheme
workplace privileges
directory-dependent git configuration
... and, as always, GitHub repositories, a new Tiny Helper and some music.
Ready? Steady. Go!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just came across Marcus Crane's post Conditionally setting your gitconfig. Marcus explains how to use conditional includes and apply directory dependent git configuration.
Here's an example from his blog post:
[user]
  email = user@example.com
  name = User
  signingkey = ABC123
[commit]
  gpgSign = true
[includeIf "gitdir:~/work/"]
  path = ~/.work.gitconfig

The git docs describe that you include configs depending on branch name, too.
I don't need different git configurations these days, but it's good to know this feature exists. 👏

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When writing Node.js automation/build scripts, I occasionally need "sleep" functionality to wait for other tasks to finish. It's not great to implement "sleeps and waits", but sometimes there's no other way than waiting for another system to finish what it's doing.
I often use the following snippet in a Node.js module script. 👇
FYI: Node.js modules support top-level await.
// File: index.mjs

const sleep = (time) => {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(resolve, time);
  });
}

// do something
await sleep(5000);
// do something else

There's nothing particularly wrong with this approach, but I'm very pleased to see that promises-based timer functions are available in Node.js 16 via timers/promises now.
// File: index.mjs

import {
  setTimeout,
} from 'timers/promises';

// do something
await setTimeout(5000);
// do something else

Less code is always better code! 👏
