The Go Developer Survey 2023 Q1 Results — Nearly 6,000 gophers took part in the latest developer survey, and now we have the results. Key takeaways include:


92% of respondents are satisfied using Go.
Error handling is now folks' biggest pain point.
Keeping dependencies up to date (if maintaining a module) is a challenge.
VS Code remains the editor of choice, with GoLand a solid second.
The majority of Go devs work on either a Mac or Linux machine (tied in terms of popularity) but Windows is notably popular with newer devs.

Rueidis 1.0: A Fast Redis Client with Caching — Endorsed enough to now be in the official Redis GitHub org at least, this is a Redis client focused on performance with auto-pipelining of non blocking commands, client-side caching implemented in the preferred way, and support for Redis’s official extensions. The only tricky part is how to pronounce it.

Do you know that SVGs provide more pointer events than HTML elements? Or that the inert attribute is now cross-browser supported? Or want to learn about CSS blend modes?
All the answers and much more are included in this week's Web Weekly!
Usually, Web Weekly starts with some thoughts about web development, but today's special.
I sent the first Web Weekly in January 2021. Fast forward two years and 99 emails; today, it's the hundredths Web Weekly edition. This email started as a little Sunday project but has now become a part of who I am.
Thank you for being one of the 3.7k people hearing from me every week. 💙
Something that made me smile this week

Have some fun with this "adoorable" one-minute-long mini-game. It comes with a little surprise at the end. 😉

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Do you remember Facebook's hugely popular like button? A quick-to-add JS snippet enabled site owners to implement Facebook functionality, and the social media giant started tracking people across the web.
It's been wild times, and luckily, things are different today. People are more privacy aware, (some) browsers started blocking all these trackers, and I stopped using Facebook years ago.
But I do watch many YouTube videos. And this made me think: how does YouTube treat privacy when you embed a video?
I was delighted to learn about YouTube's privacy-enhanced embed mode!
If you turn it on, the iframe source changes from youtube.com/embed/[ID] to youtube-nocookie.com/embed/[ID]. That's pretty cool!
But unfortunately, I just stumbled upon Jason Grigsby's disappointment about the feature.
So what's up?
First, the domain youtube-nocookie.com seemed to have been a cute developer idea until the business decided that dropping all cookies isn't great for the ad monetization model. youtube-nocookie.com does not mean no cookies.
"We won't store user info unless you interact with the embed".
Ouch... but fair; YouTube doesn't hide what they're doing here. youtube-nocookie.com isn't more than an unfortunate domain choice, but hey, we've all bought silly domains at some point, right?
But it's not okay that the explainer claims that the embed only starts storing user info after an interaction.
I just tried it out, and look what I've found in my localstorage. 🤦‍♂️
So much about, "we won't store user info unless you play the video". Not cool, YouTube. Really not cool!
