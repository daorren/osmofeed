Frequently Asked Questions About Go — Did you know there's an official Go FAQ? It's been around forever, but somehow we’d not run into it it before.. 😅 It’s packed with interesting stuff and worth a flip through. Some of our favorites:


What compiler technology is used to build the compilers?
Is there an official Go style guide?
Why does Go do garbage collection?
What's the origin of the gopher mascot?

How Grab Uses Its Own Go Module Proxy — The team behind Grab, a popular ‘super-app’ in Southeast Asia, relies on a large Go monorepo for its backend dev projects and they use the Athens Go module store and proxy to make their dev process smoother and, in particular, to reduce module fetching ti…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are plenty of DOM events and web performance metrics to consider when monitoring your site's user experience. There's Load, the holy Speed Index or web vitals such as LCP (largest contentful paint).
Harry just made a case for considering monitoring DomContentLoad, too! It's a good piece on browser events and how to get your hands on improving web performance.
And while reading it, I discovered another browser event that I probably have known about but left my memory — DomInteractive.
[DomInteractive] is the moment the browser has finished parsing all synchronous DOM work: your HTML and all blocking scripts it encountered on the way. Basically, the browser is now at the </html> tag. The browser is ready to run your deferred JavaScript.
The DomInteractive event can come in handy when evaluating your JS payloads' execution time. But I won't repeat Harry's insights here, so head over to his blog. The post is a nice deep dive!

Go 1.21 Release Candidate — Despite merely being in RC (the final release is expected in August), Go 1.21 fever is high right now. Set to be the biggest release since 1.18, there are a lot of good reasons to be excited this time, including:


The new log/slog package for structured logging.
A preview of a change to for loop variable semantics.

Improvements to type inference for generic functions.
Profile Guided Optimization (PGO) going GA.
An experimental WASI port (sample code)
Plus a lot more, and.... ↓

Built-in Functions in Go 1.21 — Some new builtin functions in Go 1.21 caught Anton's eye: min, max, and clear. Thankfully, even with these additions, there are still fewer than 20 in total…]]></summary>

Are you desperately waiting for CSS state queries? Do you wonder how to speed up your sites? Or do you want to know how to build web apps that work on flaky connections?
This week's Web Weekly includes all the answers and much more. 🫣
Roman Komarov published a real CSS custom property head-scratcher.
I mean, look at it! 🤯
The article describes how you can use cyclic CSS properties as value toggles. I'm amazed (and confused)!
It's a good explainer of the custom property inner workings.
And while being fancy, I wouldn't use this approach, because it's too clever. But hey, it's good to know about these tricks!
Nevertheless, Roman's blog is worth a follow because it's full of these nerdy CSS techniques. Here's another post about fit-to-width text with pure CSS…]]></summary>

I installed plenty of event emitter libraries over the years, and if I felt advanterous I wrote them from scratch as a quick coding exercise.
Today I learned that vanilla JavaScript comes with a native event emitter, which I've been indirectly using forever. There's no need for extra code!
The EventTarget interface

It's right in front of us; every time you use addEventListener on a DOM element, you subscribe to events from it. That's a classical event emitter. Can you reuse this functionality somehow?
I've always thought that addEventListener is part of the HTMLElement's prototype, but surprisingly it's not!

An Update on Go Toolchains — Russ Cox noted that “many people believe the go line in the go.mod file specifies which Go toolchain to use.” Not so.. but from Go 1.21 the go command will use its own bundled toolchain if that toolchain is at least as new as the go or toolchain lines in the module/workspace. If the toolchain is outdated, the newer version will be obtained. The official docs have been significantly extended to explain the situation.

Here is the bug in question in all its glory.
Twitter Tweet box not showing selection styles in Chrome.
      
    
Suppose you're writing a Tweet or DM in the Twitter UI using Chrome; the text selection is invisible. That's a pretty bad UX and an accessibility issue.
Moritz Gießmann pointed out that this bug can be fixed by turning off Chrome's experimental web features. And indeed, it makes all browsers behave the same. I'm beyond confused and will update the post later. 😅
