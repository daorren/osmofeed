        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[htmx has been pretty loud lately because it moves functionality, like swapping out DOM elements into declarative HTML. Love it or hate it, I think it's a "fresh" approach to the overcomplicated world of JS frameworks.
<script src="https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@1.9.10"></script>
<!-- have a button POST a click via AJAX -->
<button hx-post="/clicked" hx-swap="outerHTML">
  Click Me
</button>

Add the 14kb compressed file to your sites and create dynamic interactions. Everything's just a hx-whatever attribute away. Sweet!
Could you do similar things with less JavaScript? And while I wouldn't recommend using htmz in production, it does some HTML-swapping magic with 176 JS bytes. How? With very creative iframe usage.
<iframe hidden name=htmz onload="setTimeout(()=>document.querySelector(this.contentWindow.location.hash||null)?.replaceWith(...this.contentDocument.body.childNodes))"></iframe>

<!-- Loads /flower.html onto #my-element -->
<a href="/flower.html#my-element" target=htmz>Flower</a>

Is the project a joke? Sorta â€” maybe not. But whether we talk about htmx or htmz or whatever comes next, it becomes clear that we're lacking some HTML primitives. But maybe frames were already good enough? #oldIsNew ðŸ˜…

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes, I'm surprised about how smart TypeScript is. Let's assume you want to type your app's release version numbers. The format is [releaseMonth]-[releaseYear]. There won't be a new version every month or year.
How hard is it to define a type for this? It's not hard at all.
js

// define release years
type releaseYear = '2022' | '2023' | '2024';
// define release months
type releasteMonth = '03' | '07' | '11';
// combine the two types in a template literal type
type versionNumber = `${releasteMonth}.${releaseYear}`;
Â 
const version: versionNumber = '04.2022';
Type '"04.2022"' is not assignable to type '"03.2022" | "03.2023" | "03.2024" | "07.2022" | "07.2023" | "07.2024" | "11.2022" | "11.2023" | "11.2024"'. Did you mean '"03.2022"'?2820Type '"04.2022"' is not assignable to type '"03.2022" | "03.2023" | "03.2024" | "07.2022" | "07.2023" | "07.2024" | "11.2022" | "11.2023" | "11.2024"'. Did you mean '"03.2022"'?

For these situations, TypeScript defines Template Literal Types based on good old template strings. Sweet!
