Let's talk about a never-ending programming argument: TABS vs. SPACES. I know, I know... but hear me out! 😉
I don't care too much about it because wrangling code into whatever coding convention is an editor's job. Prettier for the win!
But I've always been in "the space camp" for my projects. It's my code, and I make the rules, right?
This week I took a big step, moved camps and changed my first repo to be tabs-first!
So, what changed my opinion?
The Prettier maintainers consider moving to tabs with their next major release because it saves bytes and is more flexible. Let's dive into these points.
I converted all JS files (including all node_modules) of my blog's code base to tabs and saved a whooping 11MB on my hard drive. So, this is a weak argument at best.
But off …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After ten years of being a vivid space user, I decided to move all my projects to tabs. 😲
I applied this change to this blog's repository, and a problem came to light. If you change the formatting of hundreds of files, you're messing with your Git history. git blame becomes pretty useless. Thousands of lines will be marked with an unimportant formatting change.
I started googling around to find out how to ignore commits in Git and VS code...
Ignore commits via --ignore-rev

If you use git blame on the command line, the --ignore-rev option lets you blame a file without considering this nasty formatting commit.
git blame --ignore-rev a926bba49c index.js

This is great but didn't help me because I rarely use git blame on the command line, and even if I would, I wouldn't want to always think …]]></summary>

git push --force origin main
git push -f origin main
git push origin +main

One hand the + saves some characters and somehow feels less scary to me, but on the other hand is force pushing only a single character typo away. That's scary!
Force pushing is dangerous. If you collaborate with others on a project, consider using the --force-with-lease flag instead.

Personal blogs seem to be on the rise lately. I see more and more new blogs, and I'm there for it!
Many people think that blogging is primarily about writing things down for others. It's not. My blog has turned into my own little knowledge base over the years. I don't mind publishing quick thoughts or notes with five sentences. 🤷‍♂️ If people find value in it, great! If not, also great because I posted it for my future self.
I often don't remember solutions or facts, but I remember when I made a note on my blog and read my own posts multiple times a week. I write things down to remember.
As Marco Heine puts it in "Just hit publish":
It doesn’t have to be perfect. It has to be on here. That’s the main goal.

Go 1.19 Released — First and foremost: “We expect almost all Go programs to continue to compile and run as before.” Phew! Go 1.19 isn't as significant a release as 1.18 and is focused more on refining what we already have, but what's new?


The garbage collector can now be given a soft memory limit. More here.
Go’s memory model now explicitly defines the behavior of the sync/atomic package, as we covered last week.
The os/exec package no longer respects relative paths in PATH lookups.
Doc comments now support links, lists and headings prefixed with #

Find and enable "Sticky Scroll" in your VS Code settings.
Or add the following line to your settings.json:
{
  "editor.experimental.stickyScroll.enabled": true
}

And now, see your JavaScript function signatures stick on the top.

You might argue now that for JavaScript it's an unnecessary editor feature because if you write clean code with short functions, you won't need it. But a) I'm always happy about pretty editor UI features and b) it works for other file formats such as json, css or yaml, too.
After sharing this feature on Twitter, Elio Struyf pointed out that you can also configure the sticky element's background color. 🎉
{
  "workbench.colorCustomizations": {
    "editorStickyScroll.background": "#D44",
    "editorStickyScrollHover.background": "#A00"
  }
}

It might need a little tweaking to make it work with your color theme, though. 🙈

And while I could run all of them with the node binary (node create-thumbnails.js), I prefer to remove the file extension and make the scripts executables (./create-thumbnails). This approach saves characters, and makes me feel like a hacker!
My steps to create an executable are:
Remove the .js file extension (mv create-thumbnails.js create-thumbnails).
Make the file executable  (chmod 744 create-thumbnails).
Add a shebang (#!/usr/bin/env node) to signal that the executing shell should use the node binary.
Et voilà, you just created a Node.js executable!
This approach has served me well for CommonJS-based scripts using the require function. But it's 2022, and I planned to adopt ECMAScript modules in Node.js exe…]]></summary>

What new CSS features are you most excited about? It's hands-down the :has() pseudo-class for me, because :has() flips CSS around, and content will finally be able to influence styling!
Dave Rupert published a post including this :has() selector to style the first element but only if it's included in an odd-numbered list.
But there's a surprise: you don't even need :has() for this. Temani Afif shared that you can do it with nth-last-of-type, too.
And while we're at it, do you remember this snippet? It's a CSS quantity query to select li elements, but only if there are three or more list elements. 🤯
I'm blown away by all this CSS magic, but I wonder how wild and complicated future CSS will become. We're in the :has() discovery phase right now, and we'll have to find o…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Semantic HTML is the foundation of accessible websites. Correct and meaningful elements enable assistive technology to provide a site's information in a different form or shape. A screen reader, for example, takes a site and reads it out for the visitor. These cases show why semantic HTML matters!
And yet here I am after all these years of advocating for using strong (strong importance, seriousness, or urgency) and em (stress emphasis) instead of b (bold) and i (idiomatic text – italic), only to learn that screen readers don't announce strong or em.
And while I'm not a daily screen reader user, and VoiceOver isn't the only one out there, a quick test on my Mac proves it.
Screen reader example not announcing strong or em elements.

✍️ I've been playing with the OpenAI DALL-E 2 text-to-image generator a lot in the past week and it came up with today's header graphic! I've been amused at some of its creations and have featured some of the oddest blue gophers I could conjure up at the end of this issue ;-)
