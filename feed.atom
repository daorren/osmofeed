        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Semantic HTML is the foundation of accessible websites. Correct and meaningful elements enable assistive technology to provide a site's information in a different form or shape. A screen reader, for example, takes a site and reads it out for the visitor. These cases show why semantic HTML matters!
And yet here I am after all these years of advocating for using strong (strong importance, seriousness, or urgency) and em (stress emphasis) instead of b (bold) and i (idiomatic text – italic), only to learn that screen readers don't announce strong or em.
And while I'm not a daily screen reader user, and VoiceOver isn't the only one out there, a quick test on my Mac proves it.
Screen reader example not announcing strong or em elements.

Have you ever wondered why it's currentColor and not current-color in CSS? Or why it's border-radius and not corner-radius? Or why we have to put * { box-sizing: border-box; } into every stylesheet?
The answer is simple: designing a programming language is incredibly hard. And it's even harder considering that every addition will stay on the web platform forever.
Once a feature is out there, people start using it, and that's it then. Removing or changing functionality would break the web, and we can't do this!
Every few months, I come across the Incomplete List of Mistakes in the Design of CSS. The list includes confusing CSS features that are just that: confusing mistakes.

I always thought :has() is only the long-awaited "parent selector", but Jim shared that it's the "previous sibling selector", too! 🤯
/* 
  Select every <a> element that's a child of 
  a <p> element that directly precedes an <hr> element.
*/
p:has(+ hr) a { /* ... */ }

        <id>https://www.stefanjudis.com/today-i-learned/suffix-aliases-in-zsh/</id>
        <link href="https://www.stefanjudis.com/today-i-learned/suffix-aliases-in-zsh/"/>
        <updated>2022-07-04T22:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I like geeking out on my local shell setup, and my dotfiles hold a few aliases I can't live without – ll, ni, nr and all these other two-character commands are deeply engrained in my muscle memory.
To define an alias, you set a new command name and map it to another command.
alias ll='exa -la --git --icons'

Today I learned that the alias command in Zsh also supports a -s flag which enables suffix aliases. As a result, this is a valid alias in Zsh:
# "Run" the file to look at its content
# $ index.html
# -> cat index.html
alias -s html=cat

You can "just run files" with a suffix alias without defining a command or making it an executable. After defining the alias above, executing index.html on your terminal will be expanded and shuffled to cat index.html. 😲
If you want to learn more about suffix aliases, access its manual via man zshbuiltins on the command line.
But there's more! You can define a suffix alias for multiple file types, too. I added cat (aliased to bat on my machine) as the standard handling of the following file formats.
# "Run" the file to look at its content
# $ ./readme.md
# -> cat ./readme.md
alias -s {js,json,env,md,html,css,toml}=cat

I'm super into this shorter way of looking into text files quickly.
This functionality is pretty neat already, but there's more (even though it might be a bit of a hack). @_smhmd pointed out that they use suffix aliases to save typing git clone when cloning a git repository. They paste the repo SSH link into the terminal, and it's expanded to a proper clone command. Smart! 😲
# "Run" ssh links to clone repos
# $ git@github.com:stefanjudis/dotfiles.git
# -> git clone git@github.com:stefanjudis/dotfiles.git
alias -s git="git clone"

Do you know of more suffix alias use cases? If so, I'd love to hear them via email or on Twitter!
