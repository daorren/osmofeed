        <updated>2023-04-15T22:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On my font optimization journey, I've learned that subsetting is an invaluable approach to reducing font file sizes. I've been able to cut down Roboto's size from 785kB to 200kB by subsetting it to ASCII characters. And when going the extreme way, I could even bring it down to 58kB by aggressively limiting the included characters.
But could one squeeze out even more bytes of the Roboto font?
When you inspect Roboto with Wakamai Fondue, you'll discover that it ships 13(!) variable font axes.
That's great, but I wonder if you need all these variable configuration parameters in production and argue that a good design defines only a few font variations. 13 configurable axes shouldn't be needed at all times.
Thanks to Tobias Kunish, I learned you can also remove axes with some tooling! Does the removal of font axes affect the font size? Let's find out!
Slice is an open-source application to create custom font design spaces from variable fonts. Unfortunately, I'm not enough font nerd to understand all of Slice's functionality, but what I get is that you can inspect a font's axes and limit their ranges or define a static value for each.
For example, if you're not interested in including all the variations of the parametric figure height (YTFI), set a value and drop the axis from the font entirely.
To test things out, I kept the opsz, wght, GRAD, wdth and slnt axis untouched and set a fixed value for the eight other axes to remove them from my local Roboto font.
Font
Size with 13 axes
Size with 5 axes




Roboto (all characters & glyphs)
784kB
710kB


Roboto (Latin)
322kB
292kB


Roboto (ASCII)
202kB
182kB


Roboto (only a few characters)
58kB
52kB



And indeed, removing font axes resulted in more saved bytes!
So, if you're on the journey of optimizing your fonts, subsetting will give you massive results, but if you want to go the extra mile, you can also shave off some more bytes by limiting font axis range values or removing axes entirely. Happy optimizing!

Glyphhanger lets you remove all these unused characters and glyphs.

The Smallest Go Binary - 5KB? — I thought this sounded a bit silly at first, especially dated April 1st, but the author (also the main maintainer of purego) had an interesting use case: they wanted to use Go’s assembler but not Go’s runtime. Turns out it’s possible, with a lot of fiddling around. Note: You will almost certainly never need to do this yourself, but it's fun to see the parts involved in doing so.

We're all waiting for the new parent family selector — :has(). So what's the current state?
Firefox still needs to flip the switch and is holding us back from adopting this new way of writing CSS. Nevertheless, I can imagine the new pseudo-class is terribly complicated to implement in a browser engine.
The resulting :has() use cases are endless, and we yet have to discover all the fancy ways we want to use it for. That raises the question: should everything be allowed to be used in a :has() selector? Sho…]]></summary>

SwissMap: A Smaller, Faster Hash Table for Go — The creators of the DoltDB database have open-sourced SwissMap, a Go port of a hash map from Google’s Abseil library. It uses less memory than Go’s built-in map and is well-suited for performance-sensitive contexts where memory use for large hash tables is a concern – though, as always, there are tradeoffs to consider.

Yay, HTML just got better! 👏

Make Your Go Programs Use Less Memory.. Maybe — betteralign is a tool to detect structs that would use less memory if their fields were sorted and to then, optionally, sort such fields. It’s a fork of Go’s own fieldalignment tool that skips generated or test files, skips specially marked structs, doesn’t drop comments, and similar DX enhancements.
