Do you struggle with Unicode in JavaScript? Or curse the vh when designing for mobile? Or always wanted to know how this obscure .visually-hidden class you're copying from project to project works?
All the answers and much more are included in this week's Web Weekly. 🫣
Enjoy!
This edition is the 86th Web Weekly, and for almost two years, I've been sharing weekly Frontend tips (I missed a few, but hey... 🙈).
It's odd that Web Weekly somehow became a part of my life. 💙
This week, I've chatted with my friend Anselm who runs the excellent Web Development Reading List. You should check it out!
We both wondered where we're going with our newsletters and if there's a way to collaborate.
All this got me thinking about Web Weekly.
Is it valuable to send it weekly? Should it be focuss…]]></summary>

So, I went on to learn more about it.
TLDR: the exit code 13 is used when an ESM-based Node.js script exits before the top-level code is resolved.
The script used ESM-based top-level await and performed some API requests to transform the data and write it to disk.
I needed a wait function (don't judge!) and made a silly mistake.
Here's a very simplified version of the script:
// index.mjs (ESM)
const wait = (time) =>
  new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve, time);
  });

console.log("waiting");
await wait(1000);
console.log("done");

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jim Nielsen did what he always does and shared some thoughts on the web platform. And he hit the nail on the head with "Browsers, JSON, and FormData".
So what's the current state of the web?
It's bloated with truckloads of JavaScript, and APIs power everything. APIs won't go anywhere, but we're all working on reducing JavaScript.
To drop some code while still relying on APIs, there are two options:
We need either 1) more APIs that speak FormData, or 2) browsers that speak JSON.
On point, Jim! On point. 💯
Think of it: isn't it wild that JSON APIs only work with JavaScript and Ajax because JSON requests aren't supported in HTML?
To put it bluntly: there’s no progressive enhancement if all your APIs only accept JSON payloads directly from the browser.
With the rise of all these APIs, we either have to rely on client-side JavaScript to talk to APIs directly or pipe everything through a serverless function. And we're so used to doing this that we don't even question it anymore.
The web platform is entirely broken in that sense if you ask me. And it's funny, because Jim dug up a spec that aimed to bring JSON into HTML. 😲
<form enctype='application/json'>
  <input name='name' value='Bender'>
  <select name='hind'>
    <option selected>Bitable</option>
    <option>Kickable</option>
  </select>
  <input type='checkbox' name='shiny' checked>
</form>

Unfortunately, the spec went nowhere...
But think of it: with JSON built into HTML forms, and View transitions coming up (formerly known as Shared Element Transistions), the web could really catch up and become the platform it needs to be these days.
Anyways, head over to Jim's blog; it's a good one, I promise!

Have you ever used forgiving CSS selectors? Or do you know that not all JavaScript events can be trusted? Or that aria-label can be considered a code smell?
All the answers and much more are included in this week's Web Weekly. 🫣
Enjoy!
It's funny how quickly editor habits change. Rach Smith shared some VS Code tips, and oh boy... I used to fold (⌘k + ⌘0) and unfold (⌘k + ⌘j) code blocks all the time, but I just stopped doing it for some reason. I don't know why. 🤷‍♂️

Obviously, there are thousands of shortcuts I don't use. ⌘⇧k deletes a line, but it's just not making it into my muscle memory.

On the other hand, some shortcuts just click. For example, I use ⇧⌥↓ to copy lines all the time.

Maybe I should start remapping all these commands to make them brain compatible? But t…]]></summary>

        <link href="https://www.stefanjudis.com/today-i-learned/css-clip-path-can-go-outside-of-an-element/"/>
        <updated>2022-11-14T23:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been reading one of Temani Afif's CSS magic posts and discovered a clip-path CSS trick I wasn't aware of.
clip-path allows you to clip an element in various ways. You can use geometric shapes like circles and SVG paths. It's pretty cool!
.element {
  clip-path: circle(50px at 0 100px);
  clip-path: path(
    "M0.5,1 C0.5,1,0,0.7,0,0.3 A0.25,0.25,1,1,1,1,0.3 C1,0.7,0.5,1,0.5,1 Z"
  );
}

But to be fair, I haven't used clip-path extensively, because a) my projects aren't that fancy, and b) I can't be bothered with creating complicated SVG paths.
But then there's also polygon. With polygon you can define clipping pointed with relative percentages. Handy!
.element {
  clip-path: polygon(50% 0%, 100% 50%, 50% 100%, 0% 50%);
}

And Temani shared that you can even define points outside the 100% range, too! 😲
It’s a little known fact that clip-path accepts values outside the 0%-100% range, which allows us to create “overflowing” shapes.
This detail is something I could get my head around to create some custom corners!
[Interactive component: visit the article to see it...]
Thank you, Temani!

And this makes two toggle commands! Maybe this will stick... 🤞
I only tested these command shortcuts in iTerm and the default terminal on macOS. It might be that they won't work on your machine. 🤷‍♂️

        <link href="https://www.stefanjudis.com/snippets/a-native-shell-alternative-to-the-trash-cli/"/>
        <updated>2022-11-05T23:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wes Bos has advocated using the trash-cli instead of the rm command this week.
The reasoning: rm is unrecoverable. Once you remove files or directories using rm, they're gone. Ergo, you can bring yourself into real trouble using rm.
I assume one could do some wild forensic stuff to restore bits and bytes on your hard drive, but the deleted files have to be very important to go this route.
trash can help out here! The command doesn't delete files but moves them to your operating system's trash directory. When you then accidentally delete something important, head over to your lovely bin icon and recover files from there!
But here's the kicker: installing the global trash-cli package comes with 829 dependency files. Markdown, JavaScript, JSON and license files are all at your service, making up a whopping 4.3MB heavy node_modules directory.
Sure, 4 MB isn't an issue for me on my developer machine. And the command runs fast enough to protect me and my fat fingers from self-destruction. But still, that's a lot of dependency code to move files into another directory, isn't it?
A native trash CLI function

Liran Tal thought the same and shared a nifty four-liner giving you all of trash's functionality.
trash() {
  echo "[x] moving files to trash..."
  mv "$@" "$HOME/.trash"
}

I played around with Liran's function and adjusted it also to support multiple files.
# ✅ globs          – `trash file-*-.txt`
# ✅ directories    – `trash directory`
# ✅ multiple files - `trash file-1 dir-1 file-2`
function trash() {
  echo "🗑️  Moving files to trash..."

  for var in "$@"
  do
    mv "$var" "$HOME/.trash"
  done
}

So far, my new trash command has been working great. I'll let you know when I'll discover any issues!
Disclaimer: I only tested this shell function in my environment: macOS and ZSH.

Have you ever used custom elements without JavaScript? Or do you know that there's an SVG view element? Or that you can use the caption-side CSS property with HTML tables?
All the answers and much more are included in this week's Web Weekly. 🙈 Enjoy!
Thought of the week

I didn't think it would happen, but Elon has taken over Twitter. I can't imagine what happens next after his weird sink move, immediately firing execs and making developers print out source code. 🤦‍♂️ The satire is real by now.
I'm still deciding whether to move off it, but I did check out the Feediverse and created a mastodon.social account.
But isn't this all super complicated? Yeah, I thought the same, but it's honestly not that bad!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some people love custom elements, and it seems that even more people are entirely against them. And while I'm leaning towards using them, today I learned a fascinating custom elements take.
I've been reading one of Adam Argyle's excellent component walk-throughs, and Adam shared a tool-tip custom element that works without the usual customElements.define JavaScript instruction.
To quote Adam:
You could think of a custom element like a classname with less specificity.
That's an interesting take because it changes the mental model around custom elements! Custom elements are usually used to encapsulate functionality as web components with JavaScript, but one could also use them as another style hook with lower specificity than class selectors. Neat!
Use Polypane's specificity calculator if you want to learn more about CSS specificity.
And to make the custom element accessible, Adam's example tool-tip component receives its semantic meaning via ARIA...
<tool-tip role="tooltip">A tooltip</tool-tip>

... and the show/hide functionality is then added via CSS has(). 😲
/* Only show the custom element when its parent is hovered, focused, or activated */
:has(> tool-tip):is(:hover, :focus-visible, :active) > tool-tip {
 opacity: 1;
 transition-delay: 200ms;
}

Very smart!
