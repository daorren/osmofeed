        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[That's one for my bookmarks. 🙈 I just came across this beautiful Pen by Shireen Taj. Occasionally, I'm googling how to do this with multi-color text effect with CSS and this example is just beautiful!
 by Shireen Taj (@TajShireen)
  on CodePen.

The trick is that you can define a gradient on the elements background, set the text color to transparent and define background-clip: text.
h1 {
  /* more styling rules */
  
  /* define a fancy background */
  background: linear-gradient(219deg, 
    var(--color-1) 19%, 
    transparent 19%,transparent 20%, 
    var(--color-2) 20%, var(--color-2)  39%,
    transparent 39%,transparent 40%, 
    var(--color-3) 40%,var(--color-3) 59% ,
    transparent 59%,transparent 60%, 
    var(--color-4) 60%, var(--color-4) 79%,
    transparent 79%, transparent 80%, 
    var(--color-5) 80%);
  
  /* clip the background to the text */
  background-clip: text;
  -webkit-background-clip: text;
  
  /* make the text color transparent (and invisible) */
  color: transparent;
}

If you want to have a detailed look, check Shireen's CodePen. ☝️

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Accessible form inputs are essential for building an inclusive web. It's no news that input elements should come with a properly describing label. There are two HTML-native approaches to connect a label element with an input element.
<!-- reference the id of the input element -->
<label for="email">
  Your email address
</label>
<input type="email" name="email" id="email">


<!-- wrap the input element with a label -->
<label>
  Your email address
  <input type="email" name="email">
</label>

I love the input-wrapping approach because I don't have to invent ids to connect a label with an input. Additionally, it increases the tab/click area of the wrapped input element, making it more accessible with an improved UX!
It would be such a beautiful solution if there wouldn't be the usual Frontend problem of supporting countless browsers, devices and assistive technologies such as screen readers.
Apparently, the Dragon speech recognition software is not supporting wrapping labels (Dragon product page), which means you still have to use for/id when wrapping your inputs.
<!-- wrapped input + for/id connection -->
<label for="email">
  Your email address
  <input type="email" name="email" id="email">
</label>

And that's it. This quick post's purpose is purely to have the links above at hand in the future, so that's it already. 🙈
If you want to read more about labels and input, have a look at Adrian Roselli's post My Priority of Methods for Labeling a Control.

Success Criterion 2.4.3 Focus Order (Level A): If a Web page can be navigated sequentially and the navigation sequences affect meaning or operation, focusable components receive focus in an order that preserves meaning and operability.
How can you test for this accessibility success criterion most effectively?
The first option, tab around your web pages manually and see where the focus wanders. While there's nothing wrong with this, browser dev tools (mainly Firefox) offer valuable alternatives to manual testing these days.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just came across this tweet from Josh Comeau. Josh shared that Safari is not "zooming into" focused form elements if they have a font size of or larger than 16px. I don't have an iPhone, but I can imagine that the zoom interaction is pretty distracting when you "just" want to fill out a form.
Why is Safari zooming in for controls that have a font size less than 16px? 16px is the default body font size for most browsers and is what you get after declaring font-size: 100%; on :root. 16px is the smalled accessible font size according to accessibility resources.
Josh's discovery is a fact that'll come in handy in the future because I had a few discussions about font sizes lately. Some folks tend to prefer small and light grey fonts – the less readable, the better. 🙈
I doubt that the iOS zoom argument will be the game-changer in these discussions, but the more arguments for accessible web design I have the more likely I can convince someone! 🎉

Ciao friends!
How's your week been? Surprisingly, I spent my Friday night on a rooftop terrace looking at the TV tower listening to chilled house music. It was beautiful!
Before we jump into web stuff, here's a pupper from my hidden collection. Look at this energy bundle! 😆

          
            
This week's Web Weekly includes:
Nerdy URL facts
A CodePen embed alternative
How styled components work
... and, as always, GitHub repositories, a new Tiny Helper and some music.
Ready? Steady. Go!
How a reframed question can change its outcome





          
            
Look at these two questions:
"Are you facing any challenges?"
"What challenges are you facing right now?"
Both questions ask for the same information, but they probably lead to very different resul…]]></summary>

        <link href="https://www.stefanjudis.com/today-i-learned/how-to-find-all-internal-pages-in-chromiums-and-firefox/"/>
        <updated>2021-06-27T14:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just read the article "URLs: It's complicated..." and learned a few nifty tricks about internal pages in Chromies (Edge, Chrome, etc.) and Firefox.
You might know about the hidden browser games in Chrome (chrome://dino/) and Edge (edge://surf/), or the commonly used browser flags pages (chrome://flags, edge://flags and so on).




          
            
Let's have a look at three things that make internal page handling easier!
Use about instead of your specific browser scheme

As described on web.dev, Chromium browsers rewrite not-matching browser schemes, if you enter an incorrect one. You can access chrome://flags in Edge and it'll be rewritten to edge://flags. That's already pretty handy, but there's more!
You can also use the about scheme to "resolve" to the correct browser scheme. about://flags becomes chrome://flags, brave://flags, or edge://flags depending on your browser. This rewrite is a great addition and I made it a habit to use about for all internal pages already!
You can leave out the //

While playing around with the about pages, I noticed that you can make the URL even shorter. Enter about:flags and it's correctly resolved to chrome://flags. That's pretty nice, too!
about:about – a list of all internal pages

And here's the kicker, if you wonder what internal pages your Chromium browser or Firefox provides, you can enter about:about...





          
            
And there you have it, about:about lists all internal pages! I'll continue poking around all these pages now. 👋
Pssst... If you like these short learnings, I send out a weekly newsletter.

Ads are reduced thanks to YouTube's policy for embedded videos 🙃
Works on mobile devices with butter smooth horizontal scroll.
Caveat: the template works only with YouTube content. You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.
Changed: Default HTML template meta tag adjusted to match convention

Hola friends!
Oh well... Let me be honest, my week was very long; I felt super low, binge-watched Netflix the entire weekend, and the 30+°C here in Berlin didn't help. It was pretty challenging to sit down and write this week's newsletter (but I couldn't break the 24-week streak 🙈).
I hope you had a better week and are getting ready for the summer. We all deserve it!
Before we jump into web stuff, here's a pupper from my hidden collection. It's just too cute how she leaves the scene. 😊


          
            
This week's Web Weekly includes:
GraphQL terms explained
CSS overscroll-behavior
Error cause in JavaScript
... and, as always, GitHub repositories, a new Tiny Helper and some music.
Ready? Steady. Go!
What's holding you back from being confident?
