Do you know these beautiful coding themes with fancy-looking cursive fonts? 👇



          
            
I was always jealous of people using them, and today I spent some time figuring out how that works.
A font with cursive characters and a theme using italics

You need two things to enable a cursive font in your editor:
a coding theme that leverages italics for particular tokens (not many do)
a font that is primarily monospaced but includes cursive characters for italics
My VS Code setup consists of the Yi light/dark coding theme and the FiraCode editor font. And, unfortunately, Yi doesn&#x27;t use italics and FireCode doesn&#x27;t include cursive charact…</span>

                    <span>Today I learned that the color theme I use (Yi color theme) does not support semantic syntax highlighting. Semantic what?
Semantic syntax highlighting makes sure your source code is not only beautifully colored, but that used the colors are logical, too.
After learning about this feature, I discovered that my editor&#x27;s syntax highlighting is very confusing. Functions, methods, arguments and parameters change their color from line to line. I wonder how I never noticed this chaos!
But thanks to VS Code, you can enforce semantic highlighting using the editor.semanticHighlighting.enabled setting (read more in the VS Code docs) so that syntactic tokens don&#x27;t change colors constantly! 🎉

          
            
I turned it on for now. Let&#x27;s find out if code is easier to grasp or if my brain needs unlogical always changing colors. 🤷‍♂️

                    <span>If you&#x27;re a tab hoarder like me, you probably noticed that browsers discard inactive browser tabs to save resources eventually. The tabs are still open and visible in the browser UI but are put to sleep and only brought back and reloaded on tab focus.
Today I found out that there are ways to control if tabs should be discarded and even discard tabs yourself.
In Chrome/Edge navigate to about://discards (about is a shorthand to use the same protocol in Chrome and Edge and find all open tabs ready to be controlled.




          
            
All tab entries include an Urgent Discard button to put them to sleep, and you can configure if a particular tab should be auto-discardable, too.
Similar functionality will be included in Firefox 94 at about:unloads. The page provides insights into the allocated tab resources and allows you to &quot;unload&quot; them one at a time. What&#x27;s different here is that you can&#x27;t decide which tabs to unload because the &quot;unload&quot; button only discards tabs in a prioritized order. 🤷‍♂️



          
            
All in all, tab discarding is a handy functionality, and I&#x27;ll try out discarding all tabs the next time I&#x27;m running low on memory or battery. (I can&#x27;t lose all the tabs...)
But configuring &quot;auto discard&quot; for each tab, I won&#x27;t mess with it. Browsers don&#x27;t discard active tabs like a YouTube music video or the Slack UI, and they&#x27;re probably smarter at figuring out when an active tab consumes too many resources than I am. 😉

                    <span>Bracket Colorization became a native VS Code feature with the August 2021 update, and it replaces the popular Bracket Pair Colorizer extension. The reason behind the new native functionality is that the extension suffered from bad performance when colorizing large files (I never noticed that, but hey... 🤷‍♂️).





          
            
When I went to my VS Code settings to enable the feature, I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to configure the bracket colors to match my color theme. Unfortunately, the setting description was not very helpful because it doesn&#x27;t tell what to put into workbench.colorCustomizations.




          
            
Luckily, I found a tweet by Rachel Leggett that describes how to configure the colors using the editorBracketHighlight.foreground keys.
So here we go with something to copy and paste into your settings.json.
{
  &quot;editor.bracketPairColorization.enabled&quot;: true,
  &quot;workbench.colorCustomizations&quot;: {
    &quot;editorBracketHighlight.foreground1&quot;: &quot;#5caeef&quot;,
    &quot;editorBracketHighlight.foreground2&quot;: &quot;#dfb976&quot;,
    &quot;editorBracketHighlight.foreground3&quot;: &quot;#c172d9&quot;,
    &quot;editorBracketHighlight.foreground4&quot;: &quot;#4fb1bc&quot;,
    &quot;editorBracketHighlight.foreground5&quot;: &quot;#97c26c&quot;,
    &quot;editorBracketHighlight.foreground6&quot;: &quot;#abb2c0&quot;,
    &quot;editorBracketHighlight.unexpectedBracket.foreground&quot;: &quot;#db6165&quot;
  },
}

                    <span>Moin moin, friends. 👋

I&#x27;m late with sending this newsletter because I spent my weekend watching great shows. Netflix released new &quot;Casa de papel&quot; (Money heist) episodes, and they were so good. The show&#x27;s almost too thrilling for me, but wow – I was super into it.
So! Before jumping into nerdy stuff, let&#x27;s look at some beautiful street art.

                    <span>Adrian Roselli shared that Chrome and Edge provide highly visible focus outlines.
Go to their accessibility settings pages to turn on the feature:
Chrome: chrome://settings/accessibility
Edge starting with v94: edge://settings/accessibility


          
            
When turned on, you see that focused elements receive an additional border and box-shadow.




          
            
I haven&#x27;t decided yet if I keep highly visible focus outlines turned on in Chrome/Edge, but I&#x27;d wish Firefox would offer a similar feature or improve their focus outlines at some point.
(the tiny dotted line bugs me for years by now 🙈)
Edit: Šime pointed out that you can change Firefox&#x27; focus outline by navigating to about:config and changing browser.display.focus_ring_style to 0 and browser.display.focus_ring_width to 4. 👏

                    <span>While reading an article about &quot;unknown&quot; Netlify CLI features, I discovered a little developer experience gem.
When you run netlify dev, netlify will check if there’s an open browser tab on the existing port and if so, it’ll re use that tab to display your project as opposed to spinning up a new tab every time.
As a tab hoarder, I appreciate it when development tools reuse and focus already open localhost tabs. Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t remember that I&#x27;ve ever seen a development CLI command reusing/focusing an already open tab.
How does that work? Is there an easy way to do that programmatically? And why did I never notice this?

I analyzed what the Netlify CLI does and discovered that it uses the better-opn npm package (find the usage here). The code…</span>

                    <span>Guten Tag, friends! 👋

If you&#x27;re subscribed to this newsletter for a while, you know that I discovered the electro piano duo Grandbrothers and became a big fan. I saw them live this week, and I&#x27;m so happy; live music is just the best!
Before jumping into nerdy stuff, let&#x27;s start the week with some doggo cuteness.


          
            
This week&#x27;s Web Weekly includes:
Fancy CSS features: accent-color, font-family: system-ui and color-scheme
workplace privileges
directory-dependent git configuration
... and, as always, GitHub repositories, a new Tiny Helper and some music.
Ready? Steady. Go!

                    <span>I just came across Marcus Crane&#x27;s post Conditionally setting your gitconfig. Marcus explains how to use conditional includes and apply directory dependent git configuration.
Here&#x27;s an example from his blog post:
[user]
  email &#x3D; user@example.com
  name &#x3D; User
  signingkey &#x3D; ABC123
[commit]
  gpgSign &#x3D; true
[includeIf &quot;gitdir:~/work/&quot;]
  path &#x3D; ~/.work.gitconfig

The git docs describe that you include configs depending on branch name, too.
I don&#x27;t need different git configurations these days, but it&#x27;s good to know this feature exists. 👏

                    <span>When writing Node.js automation/build scripts, I occasionally need &quot;sleep&quot; functionality to wait for other tasks to finish. It&#x27;s not great to implement &quot;sleeps and waits&quot;, but sometimes there&#x27;s no other way than waiting for another system to finish what it&#x27;s doing.
I often use the following snippet in a Node.js module script. 👇
FYI: Node.js modules support top-level await.
// File: index.mjs

const sleep &#x3D; (time) &#x3D;&gt; {
  return new Promise((resolve) &#x3D;&gt; {
    setTimeout(resolve, time);
  });
}

// do something
await sleep(5000);
// do something else

There&#x27;s nothing particularly wrong with this approach, but I&#x27;m very pleased to see that promises-based timer functions are available in Node.js 16 via timers/promises now.
// File: index.mjs

import {
  setTimeout,
} from &#x27;timers/promises&#x27;;

// do something
await setTimeout(5000);
// do something else

Less code is always better code! 👏

                    <span>There&#x27;s been some buzz about Safari (and its &quot;quirks&quot;) lately. In its latest round, the webdev community discovered that Webkit (the engine powering Safari) supports the new and fancy AVIF image format, but Safari does not. Outrageous – how can that be?
If you want to learn more about AVIF, Jake Archibald has you covered. 😉
I haven&#x27;t played much with the new image format yet, but it&#x27;s supposed to lead to smaller files than webp and jpeg. That&#x27;s great news – a faster web is a better web. You can use the picture element, let the browser load the best and newest image format, and call it a day. Win-win!
But Apple decided not to ship AVIF in Safari because the image format is not supported in their operating systems yet.
Why would one disable features that make websites faster?

Many people use ctrl + r (reverse search) to navigate and search their shell history. I never liked this shell functionality because it&#x27;s very barebones and not intuitive. McFly replaces this command and makes finding past commands a breeze!
Here&#x27;s how it looks like! 👇
