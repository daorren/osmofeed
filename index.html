                    <span>Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is &quot;experimental&quot; due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be &quot;hh:mm:ss&quot; or &quot;mm:ss&quot; for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can&#x27;t republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
Thank you @Zenigata</span>

                    <span>Changed: Smart summary truncation. When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don&#x27;t use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a &quot;pseudo&quot; summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.

Hello friends! Do you remember last week? I was so proud of sending this tiny newsletter to 1000 people for the first time. In the previous seven days, 200 more people signed up. üò≤ I&#x27;m so grateful and excited to have you all read along! A big welcome to all the new subscribers!
Before we jump into web stuff, let me share with you what made me laugh this week. Check out this URL lengthener (yes, you read that right!): the idea, the URL, the wording... I love everything about this random project. üôà


          
            
This week&#x27;s Web Weekly includes:
a free live-caption service
automation with Puppeteer
Node.js running natively in the browser
... and, as always, GitHub repositories, a new Tiny Helper and some music.
Ready? Steady. Go!

You probably know the situation. You&#x27;re trying to develop a shell script. It won&#x27;t be pretty but hopefully gets the job done. You google how to use an if or how to run a loop. You&#x27;re probably frustrated (I was at least), and you don&#x27;t realize that your script could mess with your machine&#x27;s file system because you&#x27;re fiddling around with rm -rf.
You always have to be very careful when using rm -rf! Things can go particularly wrong when you use rm in combination with variables. Let&#x27;s imaging my fat fingers comment out the first line and I run this script. My rm -rf plugins/ command just be‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>I went into the rabbit hole of writing shell scripting today. üôà The goal: saving keystrokes and manually ran commands when starting to work on a project.
Here&#x27;s the result. üëá
The video above shows a custom dev command that:
navigates into a project
runs npm run dev
opens VS Code
The exciting part is that it supports auto-completion to pass paths to projects with a working npm run dev command quickly.
A shell function to run multiple commands

To define a custom shell function that runs various commands add the following lines to your .zshrc or .bashrc.
function dev() {
  echo &quot;Running &#x27;npm run dev&#x27; in $1 ...&quot;
  cd ~/Projects/&quot;$1&quot; || return
  code .
  npm run dev
}

Run source ~/.zshrc/source ~/.bashrc or open a new terminal session to load the new configuration. Tada!!! You now have a ne‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Welcome to Web Weekly #19!

Hello friends! This week was exciting. I was invited to the &quot;Mission Control&quot; podcast, but more importantly, my tiny newsletter hit 1k subscribers! Thank you so much for reading along! üíô
Before we jump into web stuff, are you up for something thrilling? Look at this MacBook in danger. I&#x27;m not spoiling what happens there, but I love how random it is. üôà




          
            
This week&#x27;s Web Weekly includes:
resources on successful open source
a guide to ECMAscript modules in Node.js
fit-content in CSS
... and, as always, GitHub repositories, a new Tiny Helper and some music.
Ready? Steady. Go!
Don&#x27;t yell at people that do open source





          
            
I&#x27;m not doing much open source work these days, but I used to maintain one popular open source ‚Ä¶</span>

(The MDN data for Edge seems to be incorrect. I tested the current Edge and it worked fine.)
If you want to learn what it&#x27;s about, have a look at the #devsheet I tweeted a year ago.

                    <span>How many shell aliases do you have set up on your machine? I have set up quite a few general and git aliases in my config files and must admit that I still run npm install or git add because the aliases didn&#x27;t make it into my muscle memory.
The plugin alias-tips can help with that. It parses your commands and tells you to save some keystrokes and use the alias instead. It&#x27;s beautiful!
See it in action below. üëá

                    <span>ES modules are still reasonably new in Node.js land (they&#x27;re stable since Node 14). Modules come with a built-in module system and features such as top-level await.
I just read an informative post on ES modules by Pawel Grzybek and learned that you can&#x27;t import JSON files in ES modules today. That&#x27;s a real bummer because I&#x27;m pretty used to doing const data &#x3D; require(&#x27;./some-file.json&#x27;) in Node.js.
While it will be possible to import JSON from within modules eventually, the implementation is still behind a flag (--experimental-json-modules).
This post includes ways to deal with JSON in ES modules today.
Option 1: Read and parse JSON files yourself

The Node.js documentation advises to use the fs module and do the work of reading the files and parsing it yourself.
import { readFile } from &#x27;fs/promises&#x27;;
const json &#x3D; JSON.parse(
  await readFile(
    new URL(&#x27;./some-file.json&#x27;, import.meta.url)
  )
);

Option 2: Leverage the CommonJS require function to load JSON files

The documentation also states that you can use createRequire to load JSON files. This is the way Pawel advises in his blog post.
createRequire allows you to construct a CommonJS require function so that you can use typical CommonJS features in Node.js EcmaScript modules.
import { createRequire } from &quot;module&quot;;
const require &#x3D; createRequire(import.meta.url);
const data &#x3D; require(&quot;./data.json&quot;);

How should you load JSON files?

I don&#x27;t know. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Neither option feels good, and I&#x27;ll probably stick to the first option because it&#x27;s more understandable.
Let&#x27;s see when stable JSON modules land in Node.js!

                    <span>The CSS cascade and the closely related topic of CSS selector specificity are often misunderstood in the web development community. Unfortunately, my impression is that many developers never learned how CSS really works.
Trending solutions such as &quot;CSS-in-JS&quot; and Tailwind are definitely not helping with the overall understanding of this core web technology. The missing knowledge brings up the following questions:
Will it become less critical to know CSS in the future? I don&#x27;t know, maybe one day... probably not...
Do I think that it&#x27;s essential to understand how browsers apply styles today? Absolutely!
Side note: I&#x27;m not favoring or am advising to use any CSS solution out there. I prefer less complex frontends these days, but you do you!
