                    <span>Welcome to Web Weekly #22!

Hello friends! It&#x27;s summer here in Berlin! I mean, almost... 🙈 And I might have made it to get a slight sunburn today. I also started working on a new custom element for my blog () to show always-up-to-date browser support information in my blog posts. It was a good week!
Before we jump into web stuff, let me share something fascinating with you, this video shows the creation of a beautiful animation without using a computer.


          
            
This week&#x27;s Web Weekly includes:
JSON modules in JavaScript
Lighthouse updates
CSS Font descriptors
... and, as always, GitHub repositories, a new Tiny Helper and some music.
Ready? Steady. Go!
The benefits of asynchronous communication

                    <span>I learned something exciting from Jim Nielsen today. Jim shared that CSS defines system color values that follow the system color preferences (light and dark mode). If you want to learn more about the nitty-gritty details, read his post or have a look at the CSS Color Module Level 4 specification.
This post shares my discoveries after playing around with system color values such as Canvas and CanvasText.
You can find all defined system color values in the example below. Change your color preferences and see the colors below adjust!

You can see the colors react to system preferences in Chrome and Safari in the video below, too.
Here are a few things I noticed. 👇
At the time of writing, it appears that only Chromies&#x27; and Safari&#x27;s system color values take the system preferences into conside…</span>

                    <span>If you&#x27;re using EcmaScript modules, you probably know the problem that you can&#x27;t &quot;just&quot; import JSON files. To import and load a JSON file in an ES module, you have to do a &quot;window.fetch dance&quot; to request the file and parse it yourself. It&#x27;s not great...
But there&#x27;s hope! According to chromestatus.com, JSON Modules are shipping in Chrome 91. I gave it a quick try, and surprisingly, the following JavaScript code does not work.

  import data from &quot;./data.json&quot;;
  console.log(data);


It throws the following exception in Chrome 91:
Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript module script but the server responded with a MIME type of &quot;application/json&quot;. Strict MIME type checking is enforced for module scripts per HTML spec.
I didn&#x27;t have a detailed look at the spec discussion about this topic, but apparently, the new syntax to import JSON Modules is the following. 😲
import data from &quot;./data.json&quot; assert { type: &quot;json&quot; };

console.log(data);

That&#x27;s quite something, and I have to do some reading about it. But hey, anything that makes it easier to import JSON is more than welcome!
And when there&#x27;s a solution in Chrome, it can&#x27;t be long until it ships in Node.js because importing JSON files in Node ES modules is not great either. 🙈
Edit: Axel Rauschmayer shared that JSON import are based on import assertions and you can read more about it on his blog.

                    <span>Welcome to Web Weekly #21!

Hello friends! I&#x27;m a few hours late because I had such a lovely weekend. I saw some friends, listened to music and read an entertaining book. 😊 It felt like the first &quot;somewhat normal&quot; weekend for ages here in Berlin. I hope this madness is getting to an end where you live, too!
Before we jump into web stuff, let me share with you what made me smile this week. If you&#x27;re into dogs (or trampolines), this video is just too cute.

This week&#x27;s Web Weekly includes:
cutting-edge CSS features
the soon-to-be cross-browser supported requestSubmit method
the address HTML element
... and, as always, GitHub repositories, a new Tiny Helper and some music.
Ready? Steady. Go!
Things to not do yourself – email address validation

                    <span>This post is a quick reference for my future self. I implemented the eleventy cache assets plugin to speed up my local development last weekend. This site is based on API data from several sources, and unfortunately, local development became terribly slow. It was time for some optimization. The problem was that the local build process fetched all the API data on every file change and local rebuild.
The eleventy cache plugin helps here. It caches data across builds and writes the API data into files in a .cache directory. When the site rebuilds, the cached data is reused, and no APIs will be called during the build process.
To make the plugin work in a remote environment such as Netlify, it needs the .cache directory to be available. This behavior led to the problem that I had to check in the .cache directory but needed to ignore all the included files.
I ran into this exact problem many times, and it always takes me several attempts to get it right. Here&#x27;s the solution that worked for me.
First, add the directory to your local project and place a .gitignore file in it.
.cache
  |_ .gitignore

Then, paste the following configuration into the .gitignore file in the directory you want to check in.
# File: .cache/.gitignore
# Ignore everything in this directory
*
# Except for this file
!.gitignore

And voilà! Commit the .gitignore file at folder-you-want-to-check-in/.gitignore, and that&#x27;s it! The directory is now available in git and files in this directory will be ignored.
It&#x27;s to point out that .gitignore files work in sub-directories and allow you to configure git on a sub-directory level. And that&#x27;s pretty handy!

                    <span>Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is &quot;experimental&quot; due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be &quot;hh:mm:ss&quot; or &quot;mm:ss&quot; for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can&#x27;t republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
Thank you @Zenigata</span>

                    <span>Changed: Smart summary truncation. When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don&#x27;t use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a &quot;pseudo&quot; summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.

                    <span>Welcome to Web Weekly #20!

Hello friends! Do you remember last week? I was so proud of sending this tiny newsletter to 1000 people for the first time. In the previous seven days, 200 more people signed up. 😲 I&#x27;m so grateful and excited to have you all read along! A big welcome to all the new subscribers!
Before we jump into web stuff, let me share with you what made me laugh this week. Check out this URL lengthener (yes, you read that right!): the idea, the URL, the wording... I love everything about this random project. 🙈


          
            
This week&#x27;s Web Weekly includes:
a free live-caption service
automation with Puppeteer
Node.js running natively in the browser
... and, as always, GitHub repositories, a new Tiny Helper and some music.

The script in question included the following lines:

You probably know the situation. You&#x27;re trying to develop a shell script. It won&#x27;t be pretty but hopefully gets the job done. You google how to use an if or how to run a loop. You&#x27;re probably frustrated (I was at least), and you don&#x27;t realize that your script could mess with your machine&#x27;s file system because you&#x27;re fiddling around with rm -rf.
You always have to be very careful when using rm -rf! Things can go particularly wrong when you use rm in combination with variables. Let&#x27;s imaging my fat fingers comment out the first line and I run this script. My rm -rf plugins/ command just be…</span>

                    <span>I went into the rabbit hole of writing shell scripting today. 🙈 The goal: saving keystrokes and manually ran commands when starting to work on a project.
Here&#x27;s the result. 👇
The video above shows a custom dev command that:
navigates into a project
runs npm run dev
opens VS Code
The exciting part is that it supports auto-completion to pass paths to projects with a working npm run dev command quickly.
A shell function to run multiple commands

To define a custom shell function that runs various commands add the following lines to your .zshrc or .bashrc.
function dev() {
  echo &quot;Running &#x27;npm run dev&#x27; in $1 ...&quot;
  cd ~/Projects/&quot;$1&quot; || return
  code .

}

Run source ~/.zshrc/source ~/.bashrc or open a new terminal session to load the new configuration. Tada!!! You now have a ne…</span>

                    <span>Welcome to Web Weekly #19!

Hello friends! This week was exciting. I was invited to the &quot;Mission Control&quot; podcast, but more importantly, my tiny newsletter hit 1k subscribers! Thank you so much for reading along! 💙
Before we jump into web stuff, are you up for something thrilling? Look at this MacBook in danger. I&#x27;m not spoiling what happens there, but I love how random it is. 🙈




          
            
This week&#x27;s Web Weekly includes:
resources on successful open source
a guide to ECMAscript modules in Node.js
fit-content in CSS
... and, as always, GitHub repositories, a new Tiny Helper and some music.
Ready? Steady. Go!
Don&#x27;t yell at people that do open source





          
            
I&#x27;m not doing much open source work these days, but I used to maintain one popular open source …</span>

                    <span>The CSS property inset is a new shorthand for top, right, bottom and left. Today I found out that Safari supports it starting with 14.1, which means that the CSS property is now supported across all major browsers. 🎉




          
            
(The MDN data for Edge seems to be incorrect. I tested the current Edge and it worked fine.)
If you want to learn what it&#x27;s about, have a look at the #devsheet I tweeted a year ago.

                    <span>How many shell aliases do you have set up on your machine? I have set up quite a few general and git aliases in my config files and must admit that I still run npm install or git add because the aliases didn&#x27;t make it into my muscle memory.
The plugin alias-tips can help with that. It parses your commands and tells you to save some keystrokes and use the alias instead. It&#x27;s beautiful!
See it in action below. 👇

                    <span>ES modules are still reasonably new in Node.js land (they&#x27;re stable since Node 14). Modules come with a built-in module system and features such as top-level await.
I just read an informative post on ES modules by Pawel Grzybek and learned that you can&#x27;t import JSON files in ES modules today. That&#x27;s a real bummer because I&#x27;m pretty used to doing const data &#x3D; require(&#x27;./some-file.json&#x27;) in Node.js.
While it will be possible to import JSON from within modules eventually, the implementation is still behind a flag (--experimental-json-modules).
This post includes ways to deal with JSON in ES modules today.
Option 1: Read and parse JSON files yourself

The Node.js documentation advises to use the fs module and do the work of reading the files and parsing it yourself.
import { readFile } from &#x27;fs/promises&#x27;;
const json &#x3D; JSON.parse(
  await readFile(
    new URL(&#x27;./some-file.json&#x27;, import.meta.url)
  )
);

Option 2: Leverage the CommonJS require function to load JSON files

The documentation also states that you can use createRequire to load JSON files. This is the way Pawel advises in his blog post.
createRequire allows you to construct a CommonJS require function so that you can use typical CommonJS features in Node.js EcmaScript modules.
import { createRequire } from &quot;module&quot;;
const require &#x3D; createRequire(import.meta.url);
const data &#x3D; require(&quot;./data.json&quot;);

How should you load JSON files?

I don&#x27;t know. 🤷‍♂️ Neither option feels good, and I&#x27;ll probably stick to the first option because it&#x27;s more understandable.
Let&#x27;s see when stable JSON modules land in Node.js!
