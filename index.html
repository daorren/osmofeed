                    <span>Guten Tag!

Let&#x27;s start the week with some very creative work by Vincent Bal. He&#x27;s a filmmaker that uses shadows in his short scenes. 😲


          
            
This week&#x27;s Web Weekly includes:
A better history search CLI tool
Writing confident emails
Native page transitions
... and, as always, GitHub repositories, a new Tiny Helper and some music.
Ready? Steady. Go!
McFly – a reverse search replacement



          
            
Many people use ctrl + r to navigate their shell history. I never really used this functionality and usually went for a history | grep .... After discovering McFly (a reverse search replacement), I now love using ctrl + r to find previous commands.
Fly through your shell history
Today I learned – viewport units trigger overflows

                    <span>I just added a new CLI tool to my dotfiles, and I think you&#x27;re going to love it.
Many people use ctrl + r (reverse search) to navigate and search their shell history. I never liked this shell functionality because it&#x27;s very barebones and not intuitive. McFly replaces this command and makes finding past commands a breeze!
Here&#x27;s how it looks like! 👇

I was at an open-air concert this weekend. The show was so-so (for the Germans: it was a weird mix of Thees Uhlmann, Marcus Wiebusch and Bosse), but let me tell you, I do miss live music! I hope you had a good week yourself!
Before we jump into web stuff, let&#x27;s start the week with some cuteness overload. 😆


          
            
This week&#x27;s Web Weekly includes:
Chrome&#x27;s plans to break the web
Tips to not get fired
Software development without a local setup
... and, as always, GitHub repositories, a new Tiny Helper and some music.
Ready? Steady. Go!

                    <span>Dobré Ráno, party people!

I&#x27;m a little late with this newsletter this week because I spent my weekend on a boat, in a beer garden and in a Karaoke bar. And all that led to a very slow Sunday. 🙈
Other than that, I&#x27;m participating in leadership coaching right now, and last week I learned about a new approach to decision-making. My coach and I discussed three ways/lenses to look at conflicts, decisions and the world.
The reverse lens: “What would the other person in this conflict say?&quot;
The long lens: &quot;How will I look at this problem in six months?&quot;
The wide lens: &quot;How can I learn and grow from the situation?&quot;
I really like this approach of considering &quot;the bigger picture&quot; and will try to use it going forward. Let&#x27;s make less hot-headed and short-sighted decisions!

                    <span>Today I discovered an exciting section in the CSS media queries Level 5 spec. The custom media queries section explains how to define and reuse aliases for media queries. Why would you need that?
Well... if you&#x27;re using CSS custom properties and wanted to use them in a media query, you probably discovered that you can&#x27;t use custom properties in this context. CSS custom properties weren&#x27;t designed for that use case. Bummer!
:root {
  --width: 20em;
}

/* that doesn&#x27;t work :/ */
@media (min-width: var(--width)) {
}


You could now rely on tools such as Sass and introduce another non-native variable system to clean up your media queries, but yeah... this approach is not great!
But here&#x27;s the solution – say hello to custom media queries!
@custom-media --narrow-window (max-width: 30em);

@media (--narrow-window) {
  /* narrow window styles */
}

Isn&#x27;t this beautiful? I think many web developers are waiting for that for quite some time. But here&#x27;s the sad news: you can&#x27;t use custom media queries today because it&#x27;s only future music.
I googled around for a few minutes, and apparently, custom media queries are in the spec for years. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be much interest in implementing it, though. Neither MDN nor caniuse.com knows about the feature. :/
If you want to use it today, leverage PostCSS and the Custom Media plugin. That&#x27;s better than nothing, but hey... can we have custom media queries, please?

Adam Argyle filed a Chromium feature request for it now. 🎉 You can give your vote here.
Marco Biedermann pointed out that custom media queries are part of the postcss-present-env stage 1.

                    <span>Welcome to Web Weekly #30!

Buna ziua, friends!
It&#x27;s the 30th Web Weekly today, and this newsletter also passed 1500 subscribers. 🎉 Thank you for reading along and replying to the newsletter with resources and feedback. 💙
Before we jump into web stuff, let me share some &quot;typo stickers&quot; that made me smile this week.




          
            
This week&#x27;s Web Weekly includes:
predictable scrollbar spacing
the order of CSS transformations
the state of Safari
... and, as always, GitHub repositories, a new Tiny Helper and some music.
Ready? Steady. Go!
Safari&#x27;s current state – it&#x27;s complicated


          
            
Jen Simmons, CSS expert and Apple evangelist, asked for Safari feedback on Twitter recently. Her Tweet sparked many conversations about Safari and its (lacking) feature set. M…</span>

                    <span>Today I learned a small trick about CSS media queries that can help to save some bytes on the wire. You might know that you can check for user preferences using media queries.
Let&#x27;s take the prefers-reduced-motion media query as an example.👇
@media screen and (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  /* stop all these animations */
}

You can use the prefers-reduced-motion query to stop animating elements when users prefer not to see motion and animations (learn more about why you should do that on CSS-Tricks). The query can have two different values: no-preference and reduce.
If you have used this media query before, you might know that you can also use its short variant and drop the reduce value. The media query will behave the same.
@media screen and (prefers-reduced-motion) {
  /* stop all…</span>

                    <span>I came across a post by Simon Willison that described how to use the tesseract CLI command to extract text from an image. I took the opportunity to fiddle around with some shell scripting and added an extract-text-from-image command to my dotfiles. It uses tesseract to analyze an image, creates a txt file with the embedded text, copies the ebedded text to the clipboard, and deletes the txt file again.
The tesseract command was available on my machine. If it&#x27;s not available on yours, install it via your favorite package manager.
Find extract-image-from-texts last iteration below:
function extract-text-from-image() {
  if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
    echo &quot;Please specify the file you want to scan.&quot;;
    echo &quot;  -&gt; extract-text-from-image /some/path/image.png&quot;;
    return 1;
  fi

  TARGET_DIR&#x3D;$(dirname &quot;$1&quot;);
  FILENAME&#x3D;$(basename -- &quot;$1&quot;);
  FILENAME_WITHOUT_EXTENSION&#x3D;&quot;${FILENAME%.*}&quot;;

  tesseract &quot;$1&quot; &quot;$TARGET_DIR/$FILENAME_WITHOUT_EXTENSION&quot; -l eng txt || return 1;
  pbcopy &lt; &quot;$TARGET_DIR/$FILENAME_WITHOUT_EXTENSION.txt&quot;;
  rm &quot;$TARGET_DIR/$FILENAME_WITHOUT_EXTENSION.txt&quot;;
  echo &quot;🎉 Text copied to clipboard!&quot;;
}

I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use this command daily, but I&#x27;m amazed by this piece of CLI magic.
Edit: Wesley Martin shared the macOCR project with me and it&#x27;s also worth a look!
