I&#x27;m late with sending this newsletter because I spent my weekend watching great shows. Netflix released new &quot;Casa de papel&quot; (Money heist) episodes, and they were so good. The show&#x27;s almost too thrilling for me, but wow – I was super into it.
So! Before jumping into nerdy stuff, let&#x27;s look at some beautiful street art.

                    <span>Adrian Roselli shared that Chrome and Edge provide highly visible focus outlines.
Go to their accessibility settings pages to turn on the feature:
Chrome: chrome://settings/accessibility
Edge starting with v94: edge://settings/accessibility


          
            
When turned on, you see that focused elements receive an additional border and box-shadow.




          
            
I haven&#x27;t decided yet if I keep highly visible focus outlines turned on in Chrome/Edge, but I&#x27;d wish Firefox would offer a similar feature or improve their focus outlines at some point.
(the tiny dotted line bugs me for years by now 🙈)
Edit: Šime pointed out that you can change Firefox&#x27; focus outline by navigating to about:config and changing browser.display.focus_ring_style to 0 and browser.display.focus_ring_width to 4. 👏

                    <span>While reading an article about &quot;unknown&quot; Netlify CLI features, I discovered a little developer experience gem.
When you run netlify dev, netlify will check if there’s an open browser tab on the existing port and if so, it’ll re use that tab to display your project as opposed to spinning up a new tab every time.
As a tab hoarder, I appreciate it when development tools reuse and focus already open localhost tabs. Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t remember that I&#x27;ve ever seen a development CLI command reusing/focusing an already open tab.
How does that work? Is there an easy way to do that programmatically? And why did I never notice this?

I analyzed what the Netlify CLI does and discovered that it uses the better-opn npm package (find the usage here). The code…</span>

                    <span>Guten Tag, friends! 👋

If you&#x27;re subscribed to this newsletter for a while, you know that I discovered the electro piano duo Grandbrothers and became a big fan. I saw them live this week, and I&#x27;m so happy; live music is just the best!
Before jumping into nerdy stuff, let&#x27;s start the week with some doggo cuteness.


          
            
This week&#x27;s Web Weekly includes:
Fancy CSS features: accent-color, font-family: system-ui and color-scheme
workplace privileges
directory-dependent git configuration
... and, as always, GitHub repositories, a new Tiny Helper and some music.
Ready? Steady. Go!

                    <span>I just came across Marcus Crane&#x27;s post Conditionally setting your gitconfig. Marcus explains how to use conditional includes and apply directory dependent git configuration.
Here&#x27;s an example from his blog post:
[user]
  email &#x3D; user@example.com
  name &#x3D; User
  signingkey &#x3D; ABC123
[commit]
  gpgSign &#x3D; true
[includeIf &quot;gitdir:~/work/&quot;]
  path &#x3D; ~/.work.gitconfig

The git docs describe that you include configs depending on branch name, too.
I don&#x27;t need different git configurations these days, but it&#x27;s good to know this feature exists. 👏

                    <span>When writing Node.js automation/build scripts, I occasionally need &quot;sleep&quot; functionality to wait for other tasks to finish. It&#x27;s not great to implement &quot;sleeps and waits&quot;, but sometimes there&#x27;s no other way than waiting for another system to finish what it&#x27;s doing.
I often use the following snippet in a Node.js module script. 👇
FYI: Node.js modules support top-level await.
// File: index.mjs

const sleep &#x3D; (time) &#x3D;&gt; {
  return new Promise((resolve) &#x3D;&gt; {
    setTimeout(resolve, time);
  });
}

// do something
await sleep(5000);
// do something else

There&#x27;s nothing particularly wrong with this approach, but I&#x27;m very pleased to see that promises-based timer functions are available in Node.js 16 via timers/promises now.
// File: index.mjs

import {
  setTimeout,
} from &#x27;timers/promises&#x27;;

// do something
await setTimeout(5000);
// do something else

Less code is always better code! 👏

If you want to learn more about AVIF, Jake Archibald has you covered. 😉
I haven&#x27;t played much with the new image format yet, but it&#x27;s supposed to lead to smaller files than webp and jpeg. That&#x27;s great news – a faster web is a better web. You can use the picture element, let the browser load the best and newest image format, and call it a day. Win-win!
But Apple decided not to ship AVIF in Safari because the image format is not supported in their operating systems yet.
Why would one disable features that make websites faster?

Let&#x27;s start the week with some very creative work by Vincent Bal. He&#x27;s a filmmaker that uses shadows in his short scenes. 😲

A better history search CLI tool
Writing confident emails
Native page transitions
... and, as always, GitHub repositories, a new Tiny Helper and some music.
Ready? Steady. Go!
McFly – a reverse search replacement



          
            
Many people use ctrl + r to navigate their shell history. I never really used this functionality and usually went for a history | grep .... After discovering McFly (a reverse search replacement), I now love using ctrl + r to find previous commands.

                    <span>I just added a new CLI tool to my dotfiles, and I think you&#x27;re going to love it.
Many people use ctrl + r (reverse search) to navigate and search their shell history. I never liked this shell functionality because it&#x27;s very barebones and not intuitive. McFly replaces this command and makes finding past commands a breeze!
Here&#x27;s how it looks like! 👇

                    <span>Hei, party people!

I was at an open-air concert this weekend. The show was so-so (for the Germans: it was a weird mix of Thees Uhlmann, Marcus Wiebusch and Bosse), but let me tell you, I do miss live music! I hope you had a good week yourself!
Before we jump into web stuff, let&#x27;s start the week with some cuteness overload. 😆


          
            
This week&#x27;s Web Weekly includes:
Chrome&#x27;s plans to break the web
Tips to not get fired
Software development without a local setup
... and, as always, GitHub repositories, a new Tiny Helper and some music.
Ready? Steady. Go!
