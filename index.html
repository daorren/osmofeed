                    <span>Welcome to Web Weekly #27!

Ciao, friends!
I&#x27;m back from my vacation! It was full of tours on &quot;shitty bikes&quot; and long walks in Amsterdam. I really like the vibe of the city! It was perfect trip to relax and decompress. And in the meantime I got my first vaccine shot, too! Normality is approaching! 🎉
Before we jump into web stuff, let me share some wisdom I saw on Twitter.



          
            
This week&#x27;s Web Weekly includes:
an extensive guide to accessible components
new CSS viewport units
maybe unnecessary browser functionalities
... and, as always, GitHub repositories, a new Tiny Helper and some music.
Ready? Steady. Go!
Feedback for better native elements

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(1 min)</span>
                    <span>Chris Coyier shared a fascinating post describing a bug that only appeared on low-resolution devices. The post brings up the interesting problem of low-resolution devices. I usually work on a MacBook Pro and a decent monitor so that I rarely see and check the things I build in lower resolutions.
Developer tools offer ways to emulate lower DPR (device pixel ratio), and tools such as dpilove indeed show different resolution values after adjusting the DPR. However, the website still looks sharp and crisp on my MacBook. I wonder if I&#x27;m missing something here?




          
            
After reading Chris&#x27; post, I learned that you can enable low-resolution mode when developing on a high-resolution Mac. Open the app information for your browser, tick the box for &quot;Open in Low Resolution&quot; and start the application.




          
            
When you then open the app (my example shows Chrome Canary), you see a clear visual difference. The website is rendered in low resolution, everything is a bit &quot;blurry&quot;, and even the browser frame and controls are not rendered in sharp retina style anymore.
That&#x27;s good to know for future debugging sessions that deal with device pixel ratio!

                    <span>I just saw an npm package that makes copying and pasting of shell commands easier. Documented shell commands often include a leading $ character (e.g. $ npm install whatever) to signal that the code block is a shell command. And when you&#x27;re like me, you always copy and paste the $ sign with the command, leading to a command not found: $ error in your terminal.





          
            
And while it&#x27;s not a huge deal, you have to either carefully copy the command not to include the $ sign or paste the command into your terminal and remove the dollar manually. There has to be a better way...
... and that&#x27;s where the mentioned npm package comes into play. The package provides a global $ command that behaves like a proxy on your command line. The $ command simply runs all passed-in argument…</span>

                    <span>That&#x27;s one for my bookmarks. 🙈 I just came across this beautiful Pen by Shireen Taj. Occasionally, I&#x27;m googling how to do this with multi-color text effect with CSS and this example is just beautiful!
 by Shireen Taj (@TajShireen)
  on CodePen.

The trick is that you can define a gradient on the elements background, set the text color to transparent and define background-clip: text.
h1 {
  /* more styling rules */
  
  /* define a fancy background */
  background: linear-gradient(219deg, 
    var(--color-1) 19%, 
    transparent 19%,transparent 20%, 
    var(--color-2) 20%, var(--color-2)  39%,
    transparent 39%,transparent 40%, 
    var(--color-3) 40%,var(--color-3) 59% ,
    transparent 59%,transparent 60%, 
    var(--color-4) 60%, var(--color-4) 79%,
    transparent 79%, transparent 80%, 
    var(--color-5) 80%);
  
  /* clip the background to the text */
  background-clip: text;
  -webkit-background-clip: text;
  
  /* make the text color transparent (and invisible) */
  color: transparent;

                    <span>Accessible form inputs are essential for building an inclusive web. It&#x27;s no news that input elements should come with a properly describing label. There are two HTML-native approaches to connect a label element with an input element.

I love the input-wrapping approach because I don&#x27;t have to invent ids to connect a label with an input. Additionally, it increases the tab/click area of the wrapped input element, making it more accessible with an improved UX!
It would be such a beautiful solution if there wouldn&#x27;t be the usual Frontend problem of supporting countless browsers, devices and assistive technologies such as screen readers.
Apparently, the Dragon speech recognition software is not supporting wrapping labels (Dragon product page), which means you still have to use for/id when wrapping your inputs.

And that&#x27;s it. This quick post&#x27;s purpose is purely to have the links above at hand in the future, so that&#x27;s it already. 🙈
If you want to read more about labels and input, have a look at Adrian Roselli&#x27;s post My Priority of Methods for Labeling a Control.

God dag, friends!
Guess what?! I&#x27;m on my way to Amsterdam for three chilled days right now. The weather won&#x27;t be super great, but I&#x27;m excited about the sea, some wind, and good food either way.
And to my surprise, the provided wifi on my train works reasonably well, which means that I can write and send this week&#x27;s Web Weekly. 🎉 Thank you Deutsche Bahn!
Before we jump into web stuff and valuable resources, remember, the year is 50% done! Time flies at an incredible speed... 🙈



          
            
This week&#x27;s Web Weekly includes:
visualized tabbing order
surprising return values in JavaScript try/catch/finally
resources on gender-neutral language
... and, as always, GitHub repositories, a new Tiny Helper and some music.

                    <span>Focus order is a success criterion defined in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). Website visitors have to be able to navigate content and focusable element sequentially.
Success Criterion 2.4.3 Focus Order (Level A): If a Web page can be navigated sequentially and the navigation sequences affect meaning or operation, focusable components receive focus in an order that preserves meaning and operability.
How can you test for this accessibility success criterion most effectively?
The first option, tab around your web pages manually and see where the focus wanders. While there&#x27;s nothing wrong with this, browser dev tools (mainly Firefox) offer valuable alternatives to manual testing these days.
Let&#x27;s have a look!

                    <span>I just came across this tweet from Josh Comeau. Josh shared that Safari is not &quot;zooming into&quot; focused form elements if they have a font size of or larger than 16px. I don&#x27;t have an iPhone, but I can imagine that the zoom interaction is pretty distracting when you &quot;just&quot; want to fill out a form.
Why is Safari zooming in for controls that have a font size less than 16px? 16px is the default body font size for most browsers and is what you get after declaring font-size: 100%; on :root. 16px is the smalled accessible font size according to accessibility resources.
Josh&#x27;s discovery is a fact that&#x27;ll come in handy in the future because I had a few discussions about font sizes lately. Some folks tend to prefer small and light grey fonts – the less readable, the better. 🙈
I doubt that the iOS zoom argument will be the game-changer in these discussions, but the more arguments for accessible web design I have the more likely I can convince someone! 🎉

                    <span>Welcome to Web Weekly #25!

Ciao friends!
How&#x27;s your week been? Surprisingly, I spent my Friday night on a rooftop terrace looking at the TV tower listening to chilled house music. It was beautiful!
Before we jump into web stuff, here&#x27;s a pupper from my hidden collection. Look at this energy bundle! 😆

          
            
This week&#x27;s Web Weekly includes:
Nerdy URL facts
A CodePen embed alternative
How styled components work
... and, as always, GitHub repositories, a new Tiny Helper and some music.
Ready? Steady. Go!
How a reframed question can change its outcome





          
            
Look at these two questions:

                  <div class="article-summary-box-inner">
                    <span class="article-reading-time">(2 min)</span>
                    <span>I just read the article &quot;URLs: It&#x27;s complicated...&quot; and learned a few nifty tricks about internal pages in Chromies (Edge, Chrome, etc.) and Firefox.
You might know about the hidden browser games in Chrome (chrome://dino/) and Edge (edge://surf/), or the commonly used browser flags pages (chrome://flags, edge://flags and so on).




          
            
Let&#x27;s have a look at three things that make internal page handling easier!
Use about instead of your specific browser scheme

As described on web.dev, Chromium browsers rewrite not-matching browser schemes, if you enter an incorrect one. You can access chrome://flags in Edge and it&#x27;ll be rewritten to edge://flags. That&#x27;s already pretty handy, but there&#x27;s more!
You can also use the about scheme to &quot;resolve&quot; to the correct browser scheme. about://flags becomes chrome://flags, brave://flags, or edge://flags depending on your browser. This rewrite is a great addition and I made it a habit to use about for all internal pages already!
You can leave out the //

While playing around with the about pages, I noticed that you can make the URL even shorter. Enter about:flags and it&#x27;s correctly resolved to chrome://flags. That&#x27;s pretty nice, too!
about:about – a list of all internal pages

And here&#x27;s the kicker, if you wonder what internal pages your Chromium browser or Firefox provides, you can enter about:about...





          
            
And there you have it, about:about lists all internal pages! I&#x27;ll continue poking around all these pages now. 👋
Pssst... If you like these short learnings, I send out a weekly newsletter.

                    <span>Welcome to Web Weekly #24!

Hola friends!
Oh well... Let me be honest, my week was very long; I felt super low, binge-watched Netflix the entire weekend, and the 30+°C here in Berlin didn&#x27;t help. It was pretty challenging to sit down and write this week&#x27;s newsletter (but I couldn&#x27;t break the 24-week streak 🙈).
I hope you had a better week and are getting ready for the summer. We all deserve it!
Before we jump into web stuff, here&#x27;s a pupper from my hidden collection. It&#x27;s just too cute how she leaves the scene. 😊


          
            
This week&#x27;s Web Weekly includes:
GraphQL terms explained
CSS overscroll-behavior
Error cause in JavaScript
... and, as always, GitHub repositories, a new Tiny Helper and some music.
Ready? Steady. Go!
What&#x27;s holding you back from being confident?
